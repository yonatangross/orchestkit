## Workshop Flow

### 1. Setup & Objectives (15 min)

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Today we're mapping the journey of [persona] as they
[goal/task]. Our objective is to identify pain points
and opportunities to improve their experience.

We'll use this journey map as our canvas. Let's start
by reviewing who [persona] is and what they're trying
to accomplish."
```

**Review:**
- Persona overview
- Journey scope (start and end points)
- Research highlights

### 2. Journey Stages Definition (30 min)

**Activity:** Define 5-7 stages of the journey

**Questions:**
- What triggers the journey? (Entry point)
- What are the major phases?
- What signals the end of each stage?
- What does "success" look like? (Exit point)

**Common B2B SaaS Stages:**
```
Awareness → Evaluation → Purchase → Onboarding →
Adoption → Expansion → Advocacy/Churn
```

**Common B2C Stages:**
```
Discover → Research → Try → Buy → Use → Share
```

### 3. Touchpoint Mapping (45 min)

**Activity:** For each stage, map what the user DOES

**Questions per stage:**
- What action does the user take?
- What information do they seek?
- What decisions do they make?
- What channels do they use?

**Sticky Note Prompts:**
- "Searches for..."
- "Clicks on..."
- "Asks about..."
- "Compares..."
- "Signs up for..."

### 4. Emotional Journey (30 min)

**Activity:** Map the emotional experience at each stage

**For each touchpoint, ask:**
- How does the user feel at this moment?
- What are they worried about?
- What would delight them?

**Emotion Scale:**

```
😃 Delighted - Exceeded expectations
😊 Satisfied - Met expectations
😐 Neutral - No strong feeling
😟 Frustrated - Below expectations
😠 Angry - Major failure
```

**Draw the emotional curve** across stages.

### 5. Pain Points & Opportunities (45 min)

**Pain Points (Red sticky notes):**
- Where does friction occur?
- What causes frustration?
- Where do users drop off?
- What support tickets mention?

**Opportunities (Green sticky notes):**
- How could we eliminate this pain?
- What would delight users here?
- What's the "magic moment" potential?
- Quick wins vs. long-term improvements?

### 6. Prioritization (30 min)

**Impact/Effort Matrix:**

```
              HIGH IMPACT
                   │
        ┌──────────┼──────────┐
        │  DO NEXT │ DO FIRST │
LOW ────┼──────────┼──────────┼──── HIGH
EFFORT  │  MAYBE   │  PLAN    │    EFFORT
        └──────────┼──────────┘
                   │
              LOW IMPACT
```

**Dot Voting:**
- Each person gets 5 dots
- Vote on most valuable opportunities
- Discuss top voted items

### 7. Wrap-up (15 min)

**Document:**
- Top 3 pain points
- Top 3 opportunities
- Quick wins (< 1 sprint)
- Key insights
