# Value Proposition & Jobs-to-be-Done

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

People don't buy products -- they hire them to do specific jobs.

### JTBD Statement Format

```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
When I'm commuting to work, I want to catch up on industry news,
so I can appear informed in morning meetings.
```

### Job Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Functional** | Practical task to accomplish | "Transfer money to a friend" |
| **Emotional** | How user wants to feel | "Feel confident I didn't make a mistake" |
| **Social** | How user wants to be perceived | "Appear tech-savvy to peers" |

### JTBD Discovery Process

```markdown
## Step 1: Identify Target Customer
- Who struggles most with this job?
- Who pays the most to get this job done?

## Step 2: Define the Core Job
- What is the customer ultimately trying to accomplish?
- Strip away solutions -- focus on the outcome

## Step 3: Map Job Steps
1. Define what success looks like
2. Locate inputs needed
3. Prepare for the job
4. Confirm readiness
5. Execute the job
6. Monitor progress
7. Modify as needed
8. Conclude the job

## Step 4: Identify Pain Points
- Where do customers struggle?
- What causes anxiety or frustration?
- What workarounds exist?

## Step 5: Quantify Opportunity
- Importance: How important is this job? (1-10)
- Satisfaction: How satisfied with current solutions? (1-10)
- Opportunity = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
```

### Fit Assessment

| Fit Level | Description | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|

| **Business Model Fit** | Sustainable unit economics | Track CAC, LTV, margins |

## Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Customer-first** | Start with jobs, not features |
| **Evidence-based** | Validate assumptions with data |
| **Strategic alignment** | Every initiative serves the mission |
| **Reversible decisions** | Prefer options that preserve flexibility |
