## Video Hook Formulas

Master the first 3 seconds with proven patterns that stop the scroll and capture attention.

**Hook Formula:** `[PATTERN] + [SPECIFICITY] + [TENSION] = Scroll-stopping hook`

### 12 Proven Hook Patterns

| # | Pattern | Formula | Example |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Shocking Statistic | "[Number] + [unexpected context]" | "90% of Claude Code users are writing code wrong" |
| 2 | Transformation | "I went from [bad] to [good] in [time]" | "My code reviews went from 2 hours to 15 minutes" |
| 3 | Contrarian | "[Common belief] is wrong" | "Writing tests first is actually slower" |
| 4 | Direct Question | "[Pain point question]?" | "Tired of debugging the same errors?" |
| 5 | Stop Doing This | "Stop [common practice]" | "Stop writing console.log for debugging" |
| 6 | Secret/Hidden | "The [hidden] [thing] that [benefit]" | "The hidden Claude feature that 10x'd my productivity" |
| 7 | Most People | "Most [audience] [mistake]" | "Most devs use AI wrong" |
| 8 | Countdown/List | "[Number] [things] that [outcome]" | "3 commands that replaced 10 tools" |
| 9 | Story | "[Time marker], [dramatic situation]" | "Last week, our production database crashed at 2am" |
| 10 | What If | "What if [desirable outcome]?" | "What if AI could write your tests automatically?" |
| 11 | Challenge | "I [tried] [difficult thing]" | "I tried to ship a feature using only AI for a week" |
| 12 | Authority | "[Credential] taught me [insight]" | "After 1000+ code reviews, I learned this pattern" |

### Hook Intensity Levels

| Level | Intensity | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Informative | LinkedIn, YouTube |
| 2 | Curious | YouTube, Twitter |
| 3 | Provocative | TikTok, Reels |
| 4 | Controversial | TikTok, Twitter |

### The Specificity Principle

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "This tool is amazing" | "This tool found 47 bugs in my PR" |
| "Save time with AI" | "Cut code review time by 73%" |
| "Better debugging" | "Debug any error in under 60 seconds" |
