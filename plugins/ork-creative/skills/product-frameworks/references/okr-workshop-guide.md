# OKR Workshop Guide

Facilitation guide for setting effective OKRs.

## Workshop Structure

```
Total Time: 3-4 hours

1. OKR Foundations (20 min)
2. Review Company/Team Context (20 min)
3. Objective Brainstorming (45 min)
4. Key Result Definition (60 min)
5. Alignment Check (30 min)
6. Finalization (25 min)
```

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Materials Needed
- Company/team strategy docs
- Previous quarter OKR results
- Whiteboard or Miro
- Sticky notes (2 colors)
- Timer
- OKR template printouts

### Pre-Read for Participants
- Company OKRs (if cascade)
- Previous quarter results
- Strategic priorities for the period

## 1. OKR Foundations (20 min)

### Facilitator Script

```
"OKRs help us focus on what matters most and align our efforts.
Today we'll set [N] Objectives with [M] Key Results each.

Key principles:
- Objectives are QUALITATIVE and INSPIRATIONAL
- Key Results are QUANTITATIVE and MEASURABLE
- Aim for 70% achievement (stretch, not sandbagging)
- Focus on outcomes, not outputs"
```

### OKR Anatomy

```
OBJECTIVE: Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound
├── What do we want to achieve?
├── Why does it matter?
└── Is it ambitious but achievable?

KEY RESULT: Quantitative, measurable, has deadline
├── How will we know we succeeded?
├── Is it specific and unambiguous?
└── Can we track progress?
```

## 2. Review Context (20 min)

### Questions to Discuss

1. What are the company's top priorities this quarter?
2. What did we learn from last quarter?
3. What constraints do we have (resources, dependencies)?
4. What opportunities should we capture?

### Alignment Cascade

```
Company OKRs
    │
    ▼
Department OKRs (aligns to company)
    │
    ▼
Team OKRs (aligns to department)
    │
    ▼
Individual OKRs (optional, aligns to team)
```

## 3. Objective Brainstorming (45 min)

### Silent Brainstorm (15 min)
- Each participant writes 3-5 potential objectives
- One objective per sticky note
- Focus on outcomes, not activities

### Share & Cluster (15 min)
- Each person shares their objectives
- Group similar objectives together
- Identify themes

### Vote & Select (15 min)
- Dot voting (3 dots per person)
- Select top 3-5 objectives
- Discuss and refine wording

### Objective Quality Check

| Criterion | ✓ |
|-----------|---|
| Qualitative (no numbers) | |
| Inspirational (energizing) | |
| Time-bound (quarterly) | |
| Actionable (within our control) | |
| Aligned (to company/team strategy) | |

## 4. Key Result Definition (60 min)

### For Each Objective (15 min each)

1. **Brainstorm metrics** (5 min)
   - What would prove we achieved this?
   - What leading indicators matter?
   - What lagging indicators confirm success?

2. **Set targets** (5 min)
   - What's our current baseline?
   - What's a stretch target (70% achievable)?
   - What's the minimum acceptable?

3. **Refine wording** (5 min)
   - Is it specific and measurable?
   - Is the target ambitious but realistic?
   - Can we track this?

### Key Result Formula

```
[Verb] [metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [deadline]

Examples:
- Increase NPS from 32 to 50
- Reduce time-to-value from 14 days to 3 days
- Achieve 95% feature adoption in first 30 days
```

### KR Quality Check

| Criterion | ✓ |
|-----------|---|
| Quantitative (has number) | |
| Measurable (we can track it) | |
| Has baseline | |
| Has target | |
| Outcome-focused (not output) | |
| 70% achievable stretch | |

## 5. Alignment Check (30 min)

### Vertical Alignment
- Does this OKR support a higher-level objective?
- Is the connection clear?

### Horizontal Alignment
- Do any OKRs conflict with other teams?
- Are there dependencies we need to coordinate?

### Sanity Check Questions
- If we achieve all KRs, will we achieve the Objective?
- Can we actually measure each KR?
- Are we tracking too many things?

## 6. Finalization (25 min)

### Final OKR Template

```markdown
## Objective: [Inspiring statement]

**Key Results:**
1. [Verb] [metric] from [X] to [Y]
   - Baseline: X
   - Target: Y
   - Owner: @name

2. [Verb] [metric] from [X] to [Y]
   - Baseline: X
   - Target: Y
   - Owner: @name

3. [Verb] [metric] from [X] to [Y]
   - Baseline: X
   - Target: Y
   - Owner: @name
```

### Post-Workshop Actions
- [ ] Document final OKRs
- [ ] Set up tracking dashboard
- [ ] Schedule weekly check-ins
- [ ] Schedule mid-quarter review
- [ ] Share with stakeholders
