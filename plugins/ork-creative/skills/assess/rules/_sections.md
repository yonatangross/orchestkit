# Rule Categories

## 1. Complexity Metrics (metrics) — HIGH — 1 rule

Scoring frameworks for evaluating task complexity across 7 criteria. Determines whether to proceed or decompose.

- `complexity-metrics.md` — 7-criterion scoring (1-5), complexity levels, decision thresholds

## 2. Complexity Breakdown (breakdown) — HIGH — 1 rule

Task decomposition strategies when complexity exceeds thresholds. Turns complex tasks into manageable subtasks.

- `complexity-breakdown.md` — Decomposition strategies, codebase analysis, risk assessment
