# Rule Categories

## 1. ASCII Diagram Patterns (diagrams) — MEDIUM — external

ASCII diagram patterns live in the `ascii-visualizer` skill. Plan-viz depends on `ascii-visualizer` via the `skills:` frontmatter field.

See: `ascii-visualizer` skill rules for box-drawing characters, file trees, progress bars, workflow diagrams, layered architecture, blast radius, reversibility timelines, and comparisons.

## 2. Section Rendering Conventions (visualization) — HIGH — 1 rule

Rules for rendering each plan-viz section with consistent style, annotations, and structure.

- `section-rendering.md` — Change manifest symbols, swimlane conventions, risk dashboard format, decision log structure, impact summary template
