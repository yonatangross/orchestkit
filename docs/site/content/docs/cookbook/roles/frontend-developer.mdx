## You're a frontend developer. Here's your toolkit.

You build React components, manage client state, fetch data, and chase down layout shifts. OrchestKit gives you 7 skills spanning React Server Components, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, animations, and performance optimization -- plus 3 agents that can build UI, profile render performance, and audit accessibility without you leaving the terminal. Skills are injected based on what you're building, so the right patterns show up when you need them.

## Your Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `react-server-components-framework` | Next.js 16+ App Router, Cache Components, streaming SSR, Server Actions, and React 19 patterns |
| `shadcn-patterns` | CVA variants, OKLCH theming, cn() utility, and component composition for shadcn/ui |
| `tanstack-query-advanced` | TanStack Query v5 infinite queries, optimistic updates, prefetching, gcTime, and queryOptions |
| `core-web-vitals` | LCP, INP, CLS optimization with 2026 thresholds, performance budgets, and RUM setup |
| `motion-animation-patterns` | Motion (Framer Motion) presets for page transitions, stagger effects, modals, and skeleton loaders |
| `zustand-patterns` | Zustand 5.x slices, middleware, Immer integration, useShallow, and persistence patterns |
| `lazy-loading-patterns` | React.lazy, Suspense, route-based splitting, intersection observer, and preload strategies |

## Your Agents

| Agent | Model | Activates when... |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend-ui-developer` | inherit | React, TypeScript, component, UI, optimistic updates, Zod, TanStack, Suspense, form, lazy loading |
| `performance-engineer` | inherit | performance, Core Web Vitals, LCP, INP, CLS, bundle size, Lighthouse, profiling, RUM |
| `accessibility-specialist` | inherit | accessibility, a11y, WCAG, screen reader, keyboard navigation, ARIA, focus management |

## Your Workflows

- **[Implement a Feature](/docs/cookbook/implement-feature)** -- Describe a UI feature, get components built with proper types, tests, and accessibility baked in
- **[Review a Pull Request](/docs/cookbook/review-pr)** -- Multi-agent PR review covering code quality, performance impact, and accessibility compliance

## Quick Start

Try this right now:

```bash
/ork:implement "Add an infinite-scroll data table with optimistic row deletion"
```

The `frontend-ui-developer` agent activates with `tanstack-query-advanced` and `shadcn-patterns` injected, producing a table component with infinite query pagination, optimistic delete mutations, and skeleton loading states.
