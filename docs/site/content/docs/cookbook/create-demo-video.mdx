import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Scenario

You just shipped a new authentication flow: login, signup, OAuth, token refresh, password reset. The code works. The tests pass. Now your team lead asks for a 60-second demo video to show stakeholders.

You could open QuickTime, fumble through screen recordings, splice clips in iMovie, and spend two hours on something that looks amateur. Or you can let OrchestKit orchestrate the entire pipeline -- from storyboard to rendered video with background music and thumbnails -- in a single command.

## What You'll Use

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/ork:demo-producer` | Command skill | Orchestrates the full video pipeline |
| `demo-producer` | Agent | Coordinates storyboard, recording, composition |
| `video-storyboarding` | Reference skill | AI scene breakdown with timing |
| `terminal-demo-generator` | Reference skill | VHS terminal recording automation |
| `remotion-composer` | Reference skill | Programmatic video composition with React |
| `music-sfx-selection` | Reference skill | Background music and sound effects |
| `thumbnail-first-frame` | Reference skill | Cover image generation |
| `content-type-recipes` | Reference skill | Video structure templates by type |
| `hook-formulas` | Reference skill | Attention and retention patterns |

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Launch the Pipeline

Start with a description of what you want to demo:

```bash
/ork:demo-producer "Demo the new authentication flow — login, OAuth, and token refresh"
```

The `demo-producer` agent activates and asks you to choose a video type:

```
What type of video?

  1. Feature Demo     — Show a feature in action (60-90s)
  2. Tutorial          — Step-by-step walkthrough (2-5min)
  3. Release Notes     — Changelog highlights (30-60s)

> 1
```

Choose **Feature Demo** for a concise stakeholder-facing clip.

### Step 2: Storyboarding

The agent generates a scene-by-scene breakdown using the `video-storyboarding` skill. Each scene has a visual description, timing, text overlay, and audio note:

```
Storyboard: "Authentication Flow Demo"
Duration: 60 seconds | Aspect: 16:9 + 1:1

Scene 1 (0:00-0:08) — Hook
  Visual: Split-screen: old login page vs new login page
  Text overlay: "Authentication, reimagined"
  Audio: Upbeat intro sting

Scene 2 (0:08-0:22) — Login Flow
  Visual: Terminal recording — user signs up, receives JWT
  Text overlay: "JWT-based auth with automatic refresh"
  Audio: Ambient background

Scene 3 (0:22-0:36) — OAuth Integration
  Visual: Browser recording — Google OAuth flow
  Text overlay: "One-click OAuth for Google, GitHub, Apple"
  Audio: Continue ambient

Scene 4 (0:36-0:48) — Token Refresh
  Visual: Terminal — token expires, auto-refreshes, request succeeds
  Text overlay: "Seamless token refresh — zero user interruption"
  Audio: Continue ambient

Scene 5 (0:48-0:60) — CTA
  Visual: Code diff — before/after line count
  Text overlay: "Ship it. /ork:implement"
  Audio: Outro sting

Approve storyboard? [Y/edit/n]
```

Type `Y` to approve, or `edit` to modify individual scenes. The storyboard is saved as `storyboard.json` for reuse.

### Step 3: Terminal Recording

For scenes that show terminal interactions, OrchestKit uses **VHS** (the terminal recorder by Charm) to create reproducible recordings:

```bash
# VHS generates a .tape file for each terminal scene
# Scene 2: Login flow
Output scene-2-login.gif
Set FontSize 16
Set Width 1200
Set Height 800
Set Theme "Catppuccin Mocha"

Type "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/auth/signup"
Enter
Sleep 1s
Type '  -d '"'"'{"email":"demo@example.com","password":"secure123"}'"'"''
Enter
Sleep 2s

# Response appears...
```

The `terminal-demo-generator` skill handles `.tape` file creation. VHS renders each scene as a GIF or MP4 clip.

<Callout type="info">
VHS must be installed locally: `brew install vhs`. If not available, OrchestKit falls back to static code screenshots with syntax highlighting. The video still renders -- just with stills instead of animated terminal sequences.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Composition with Remotion

The `remotion-composer` skill assembles all scene clips into a final video using Remotion (React-based programmatic video):

```
Composing video...
  Composition: ScrapbookDemo (16:9)
  Scenes: 5 clips loaded
  Transitions: paper-fold (100-200ms between scenes)
  Background: warm paper texture (#F0F0E8)
  Text overlays: Tiempos serif for impact, Inter sans-serif for data
  Duration: 60.0s @ 30fps

Rendering 16:9...  [====================] 100%
Rendering 1:1...   [====================] 100%

Output:
  ./output/auth-demo-16x9.mp4  (1920x1080, 12.4 MB)
  ./output/auth-demo-1x1.mp4   (1080x1080, 8.7 MB)
```

The composition uses the **Anthropic "Scrapbook Motion"** visual style:
- Warm paper backgrounds (`#F0F0E8`), not dark themes
- Fast cuts (100-200ms transitions) with paper-fold effects
- Mixed media collage: terminal recordings, browser captures, code diffs
- Typography: Tiempos (serif) for headings, Inter (sans-serif) for data

<Callout type="info">
Two registered compositions handle most use cases: **ScrapbookDemo** for feature demos and **ReleaseNotes** for changelog videos. Both render in 16:9 and 1:1 aspect ratios automatically. OrchestKit has 79 total Remotion compositions for specialized needs.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Audio Generation

The pipeline adds audio using **Kling 3.0** as the primary source:

```
Generating audio...
  Engine: Kling 3.0 (native audio, 5 languages)
  Intro sting: 3s upbeat electronic
  Background: 54s ambient lo-fi
  Outro sting: 3s fade-out

  Mixing...
  Audio levels: music -18dB, SFX -12dB
  Output: ./output/auth-demo-audio.mp3
```

Kling 3.0 generates background music natively -- multi-shot, 4K at 60fps, up to 15 seconds per clip, with audio in 5 languages. For longer tracks, clips are stitched with crossfade.

Optionally, add voice narration via ElevenLabs (backup TTS):

```bash
# Only if you want narration — most feature demos skip it
/ork:demo-producer --narrate "Demo the new authentication flow"
```

<Callout type="warn">
Audio generation requires the `KLING_API_KEY` environment variable. Optional fallbacks: `FAL_KEY` for video generation, `SUNO_API_KEY` for music. Without any keys, the video renders silently -- still usable, just without generated audio.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Thumbnail Generation

The `thumbnail-first-frame` skill generates a cover image from the first scene:

```
Generating thumbnail...
  Source: Scene 1, frame 0
  Style: Scrapbook Motion (paper texture + bold text)
  Text: "Authentication Flow Demo"
  Sizes:
    ./output/thumb-1280x720.png  (YouTube)
    ./output/thumb-1080x1080.png (Social)
```

### Final Output

The complete pipeline produces:

```
Pipeline complete!

Files:
  ./output/auth-demo-16x9.mp4      1920x1080, 60s, 12.4 MB
  ./output/auth-demo-1x1.mp4       1080x1080, 60s, 8.7 MB
  ./output/auth-demo-audio.mp3     60s, 1.2 MB
  ./output/thumb-1280x720.png      YouTube thumbnail
  ./output/thumb-1080x1080.png     Social thumbnail
  ./output/storyboard.json         Scene data (reusable)

Elapsed: 4m 32s
```

## Behind the Scenes

### Agent Orchestration

When you invoke `/ork:demo-producer`, the `demo-producer` agent spawns and coordinates a multi-step pipeline. Here is the full execution flow:

```
/ork:demo-producer "Demo the new authentication flow"
    |
    +---> demo-producer agent spawns (model: opus)
    |       Skills injected:
    |         video-storyboarding
    |         terminal-demo-generator
    |         remotion-composer
    |         music-sfx-selection
    |         thumbnail-first-frame
    |         content-type-recipes
    |         hook-formulas
    |
    +---> Step 1: Storyboard generation
    |       content-type-recipes skill -> selects "Feature Demo" template
    |       video-storyboarding skill -> generates scene breakdown
    |       hook-formulas skill -> inserts attention patterns (hook, payoff, CTA)
    |
    +---> Step 2: Asset creation (parallel)
    |       terminal-demo-generator -> VHS recordings for terminal scenes
    |       Browser recording -> Playwright captures for UI scenes
    |
    +---> Step 3: Composition
    |       remotion-composer -> assembles clips into ScrapbookDemo composition
    |       Renders both 16:9 and 1:1 variants
    |
    +---> Step 4: Audio (parallel with thumbnail)
    |       music-sfx-selection -> selects style and generates via Kling 3.0
    |       Audio mixing: music at -18dB, SFX at -12dB
    |
    +---> Step 5: Thumbnail
    |       thumbnail-first-frame -> extracts frame, applies Scrapbook style
    |
    +---> Final: Merge audio + video, output files
```

### Hooks That Fire

Throughout the pipeline, several hooks fire automatically:

| Hook | Event | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `session-env-setup` | lifecycle/start | Detects `KLING_API_KEY`, `FAL_KEY`, `SUNO_API_KEY` availability |
| `dangerous-command-blocker` | pretool/bash | Validates VHS and ffmpeg commands before execution |
| `file-guard` | pretool/write | Prevents overwriting existing output files without confirmation |
| `audit-logger` | posttool/bash | Records every tool execution for pipeline reproducibility |
| `session-metrics` | posttool/bash | Tracks render times, file sizes, scene counts |

### The Scrapbook Motion Style

OrchestKit's video output follows the Anthropic "Scrapbook Motion" aesthetic, inspired by the Claude Opus 4 announcement video:

| Element | Specification |
|---|---|
| Background | Warm paper texture `#F0F0E8` (not dark) |
| Transitions | Fast cuts, 100-200ms, paper-fold effect |
| Typography | Tiempos serif for impact text, Inter sans-serif for data |
| Media | Mixed collage: terminal, browser, code, diagrams |
| Audio | Lo-fi ambient, electronic stings for transitions |
| Voiceover | None by default (clean, visual-first) |

This style ensures every video produced through OrchestKit has a consistent, professional look without requiring design skills.

### Remotion Composition Registry

OrchestKit registers 79 Remotion compositions. The two most commonly used for demo videos:

| Composition | Use Case | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `ScrapbookDemo` | Feature demos, tutorials | 16:9 + 1:1 |
| `ReleaseNotes` | Changelog and version highlights | 16:9 + 1:1 |

Each composition is a React component that accepts scene data (clips, overlays, timing) as props and renders a programmatic video. The scene data comes from `storyboard.json`, making every video fully reproducible.

### Kling 3.0 Capabilities

Kling 3.0 (launched February 4, 2026) is the primary video and audio engine:

| Feature | Specification |
|---|---|
| Resolution | Up to 4K at 60fps |
| Duration | Up to 15 seconds per clip |
| Audio | Native generation in 5 languages |
| Multi-shot | Up to 6 cuts per generation |
| Element Library | Reusable assets and overlays |

ElevenLabs serves as a backup TTS provider, used only when explicit narration is requested. HeyGen was deprecated in favor of Kling 3.0 for all video generation tasks.

## Tips

<Callout type="info">
**Reuse storyboards.** The `storyboard.json` output file contains the full scene breakdown. Pass it back for iteration: `/ork:demo-producer --storyboard ./output/storyboard.json` skips the storyboarding step and goes straight to rendering. Useful for tweaking individual scenes without regenerating everything.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Use 1:1 for social, 16:9 for presentations.** Both aspect ratios render by default. The 1:1 version is optimized for Twitter/LinkedIn feeds where square video gets more screen real estate. The 16:9 version is standard for YouTube, Slack, and slide decks.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Large videos need disk space.** Remotion renders frame-by-frame. A 60-second video at 30fps generates 1800 frames as intermediate PNGs before encoding to MP4. Ensure at least 2 GB of free disk space for the render. Intermediate files are cleaned up automatically after encoding.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Add vertical video for TikTok and Reels.** Use the `--vertical` flag to generate a 9:16 output alongside the standard formats: `/ork:demo-producer --vertical "Demo the auth flow"`. The storyboarding skill automatically reframes scenes for portrait orientation, repositioning text overlays and cropping terminal recordings.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**No API keys? No problem.** Without `KLING_API_KEY`, the pipeline still generates the video -- just without generated audio. You can add a royalty-free music track manually in any video editor, or re-run with the key later using the saved storyboard. The pipeline is designed for graceful degradation at every step.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Generate release videos from changelogs.** For release notes videos, pass your version tag: `/ork:demo-producer --type release-notes v6.0.2`. The agent reads your CHANGELOG.md, extracts highlights, and generates a ReleaseNotes composition automatically. No storyboarding step needed -- the changelog is the storyboard.
