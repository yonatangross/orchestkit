## General

### What version of Claude Code do I need?

OrchestKit requires Claude Code 2.1.34 or later. Check your version:

```bash
claude --version
```

Upgrade if needed:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

### How do I install OrchestKit?

OrchestKit is a single plugin: **ork** — 69 skills, 38 agents, 85 hooks. Install with `claude install orchestkit/ork`.

### Can I use OrchestKit with other Claude Code plugins?

Yes. OrchestKit is designed to coexist with other plugins. Skills, agents, and hooks are namespaced under `ork:` to avoid conflicts. If you encounter a naming collision, [open an issue](https://github.com/yonatangross/orchestkit/issues).

### Does OrchestKit send data externally?

No data is sent externally by default. The only optional external service is:

- **Tavily**: If you set `TAVILY_API_KEY`, web research skills use Tavily's search API

This is opt-in via an environment variable. Without it, OrchestKit operates entirely locally.

## Skills

### How many skills are there?

69 total: 17 command skills (user-invocable via `/ork:skillname`) and 52 reference skills (knowledge modules auto-injected by agents and hooks).

### What does `complexity: low|medium|high|max` mean?

The complexity field in skill frontmatter aligns with Opus 4.6's adaptive thinking system. Higher complexity skills get more compute budget for reasoning:

| Level | Thinking Budget | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `low` | Minimal | Simple workflows like `/ork:commit` |
| `medium` | Moderate | Multi-agent workflows like `/ork:implement` |
| `high` | Extended | Deep analysis like `/ork:audit-full` |
| `max` | Maximum | Exhaustive evaluation like `/ork:upgrade-assessment` |

### Can I write my own skills?

Yes. Create a directory in `src/skills/your-skill/` with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter. See [Writing Skills](/docs/skills/writing-skills) for the full guide.

### Why do some skills have `context: fork` and others `context: inherit`?

- `context: fork` -- The skill runs in an isolated context. This is the default for most skills and prevents one skill's state from leaking into another.
- `context: inherit` -- The skill shares the parent context. Used by `/ork:commit` because it needs access to the current git state.
- `context: none` -- The skill does not need conversation context. Used by `/ork:remember` which only writes to the knowledge graph.

## Agents

### How do agents get their skills?

Agents list skills in their frontmatter `skills:` field. When an agent is spawned, Claude Code 2.1.6+ automatically loads those skills into the agent's context. You do not need to manually inject skills.

```yaml
# Example: backend-system-architect.md
skills:
  - api-design-framework
  - database-schema-designer
  - clean-architecture
```

### What is the difference between Agent Teams and Task tool?

| Aspect | Task Tool (Star) | Agent Teams (Mesh) |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Communication | All agents report to lead | Agents message each other |
| Coordination | Lead synthesizes results | Agents cross-reference directly |
| Cost | ~200K tokens | ~500K tokens |
| Best for | Focused, independent tasks | Complex tasks with cross-cutting concerns |

Agent Teams requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. When not set, OrchestKit falls back to the Task tool automatically.

### Can I create my own agents?

Yes. Create a markdown file in `src/agents/your-agent.md` with YAML frontmatter. See [Writing Agents](/docs/agents/writing-agents) for the format.

---

## Hooks

### How many hooks are there?

78 total: 55 global hooks, 22 agent-scoped hooks, and 1 skill-scoped hook. They are compiled into 12 split bundles for faster loading.

### What are fire-and-forget hooks?

Seven hooks use an async dispatch pattern where they start background work (analytics, network requests, startup tasks) and immediately return `{"continue": true}` without waiting for the background work to complete. This prevents slow operations from blocking the user's workflow.

### Can I disable a specific hook?

Yes. Edit `src/hooks/hooks.json` and set `"enabled": false` on the hook entry. This is useful for debugging or when a hook conflicts with your workflow. Remember to rebuild after editing: `cd src/hooks && npm run build`.

---

## Memory

### How does memory work without any configuration?

All 3 tiers work out of the box with zero configuration. Decisions are stored in the MCP knowledge graph (Tier 1), backed up to `.claude/memory/*.jsonl` files (Tier 2), and high-confidence decisions are promoted to CC Native MEMORY.md (Tier 3).

### What gets stored automatically?

OrchestKit's `auto-remember-continuity` hook automatically stores high-confidence decisions at session end. Manually, you control what gets stored with `/ork:remember`. Nothing is stored without your action or the automatic hook's confidence threshold (0.7 or above).

### Can I delete memories?

Yes. Memories in the knowledge graph can be managed via the MCP memory tools. Local memory files (`.claude/memory/*.jsonl`) can be edited or deleted directly. CC Native MEMORY.md can be edited manually.

### Does memory work across different projects?

By default, memory is project-scoped. Use `/ork:remember --global` to store patterns that should be available across all projects. Search with `/ork:memory search --global` to find them.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | Auto-set | User's project directory |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Auto-set | Plugin installation directory |
| `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` | Auto-set | Current session UUID |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables Tavily search in web research skills |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | Optional | Enables Agent Teams coordination mode |

## Cursor

### Cursor shows "plugin-ork-author MCP fails -- No stored tokens"

This is a known Cursor bug. Cursor misreads the `author` metadata field in OrchestKit's plugin manifest as an MCP server registration. OrchestKit has no MCP server named "author".

**Workaround**: Open Cursor Settings, go to the MCP section, and disable the "author" entry. This does not affect OrchestKit functionality.

<Callout type="info">
This issue is tracked in [#698](https://github.com/yonatangross/orchestkit/issues/698). It only affects Cursor -- Claude Code handles the `author` field correctly.

## Compatibility

### Does OrchestKit work on Windows?

OrchestKit is developed and tested on macOS and Linux. Windows support is best-effort. Known issues:

- `memory-writer.test.ts` fails on Windows due to path separator differences
- Some shell scripts assume Bash

### Does OrchestKit work with models other than Claude?

No. OrchestKit is a Claude Code plugin and requires Claude models. The skill complexity levels are calibrated for Opus 4.6's adaptive thinking system.

### Can I use OrchestKit in a CI/CD pipeline?

OrchestKit is designed for interactive development sessions, not headless CI. However, the validation scripts (`npm test`, `npm run test:security`) can run in CI to enforce skill and hook quality.
