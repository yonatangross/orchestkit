title: "Validate Counts"
description: "Validates hook, skill, and agent counts are consistent across CLAUDE.md, hooks.json, manifests, and source directories. Use when counts may be stale after adding or removing components, before releases, or when CLAUDE.md Project Overview looks wrong."

# Validate Counts

Checks that hook, skill, and agent counts are consistent across all authoritative sources in OrchestKit. Outputs a comparison table and flags drift with precise file references.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full validation: counts src/ vs CLAUDE.md and manifests (run from repo root)
bash src/skills/validate-counts/scripts/validate-counts.sh

# Just get raw counts from src/
bash src/skills/validate-counts/scripts/count-all.sh
```

## Rules

| Category | Rule | Impact | Key Pattern |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Count Sources | `rules/sources-authoritative.md` | HIGH | Filesystem is authoritative; derived sources must match |
| Drift Detection | `rules/drift-reporting.md` | HIGH | Comparison table + flag with file:field references |

**Total: 2 rules across 2 categories**

## Workflow

1. Run `scripts/validate-counts.sh` for full validation (counts + drift comparison), or `scripts/count-all.sh` for raw counts only
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` — extract counts from Project Overview and Version section
3. Read `manifests/ork.json` — check skill/agent/hook array lengths
4. Build the comparison table (see `rules/drift-reporting.md` for format)
5. Flag any mismatches with file + field references; otherwise output "All counts consistent."

## Common Mistakes

1. Counting from `plugins/` instead of `src/` — plugins/ may be empty after an interrupted build
2. Comparing against deleted alias manifests — only `manifests/ork.json` exists in v7
3. Forgetting the hook breakdown: global + agent-scoped + skill-scoped must sum to total

## Rules (2)

### Report drift accurately so CLAUDE.md counts reflect the actual codebase state — HIGH


## Drift Detection and Reporting

After counting all sources, compare them and report using a structured table. Flag every mismatch with a specific file and field reference.

### Comparison Table Format

Output one table row per source. Use MATCH or DRIFT in the Status column.

```
| Source                        | Skills | Agents | Hooks | Status |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| src/skills/ (actual)          | 63     | —      | —     | —      |
| src/agents/ (actual)          | —      | 37     | —     | —      |
| src/hooks/hooks.json (actual) | —      | —      | 87    | —      |
| CLAUDE.md Project Overview    | 63     | 37     | 87    | MATCH  |
| CLAUDE.md Version section     | —      | —      | 85    | DRIFT  |
| manifests/ork.json            | 63     | 36     | 87    | MATCH  |
```

### Flagging Drift

For each DRIFT row, output a specific fix instruction:

```
DRIFT: CLAUDE.md Version section says "85 entries" but hooks.json has 87.
  Fix: Update src/hooks/README.md line ~5 and CLAUDE.md Version section to "87 entries"
```

Include:
1. Which file has the wrong value
2. What the correct value is
3. Approximate line number or field name where the stale count appears

### Known Legitimate Differences

These are NOT drift — do not flag them:

| Difference | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Agent count in manifests = actual - 1 | Some agents may be internal-only and excluded from manifest |

**Incorrect:**

```
DRIFT: CLAUDE.md has wrong hook count.
```

**Correct:**

```
DRIFT: CLAUDE.md Version section says "85 entries" but hooks.json has 87.
  Fix: Update CLAUDE.md Version section (line ~42) to "87 entries"
```

### Key Rules

- If all counts match, output "All counts consistent." and stop
- Always show the full table even when there is no drift — it confirms what was checked
- Reference file + field, not just file, when flagging drift (e.g., "CLAUDE.md line 7, Project Overview")


### Read from authoritative count sources to prevent false-positive drift detection — HIGH


## Authoritative Count Sources

Each count has exactly one authoritative source (the filesystem/JSON) and multiple derived sources (docs/manifests) that must stay in sync.

### Hooks

**Authoritative**: `src/hooks/hooks.json` — count entries in the top-level `hooks` array.

```bash
# Count hook entries
jq '.hooks | length' src/hooks/hooks.json
```

Derived sources to check against:
- `CLAUDE.md` Project Overview line: "N hooks (X global + Y agent-scoped + Z skill-scoped)"
- `CLAUDE.md` Version section: "N entries (X global + Y agent-scoped + Z skill-scoped, ...)"
- `src/hooks/hooks.json` top-level `description` field (may embed count)
- `manifests/ork.json` — hook count in metadata

### Skills

**Authoritative**: `src/skills/` — count subdirectories (each directory = one skill).

```bash
# Count skill directories
ls -d src/skills/*/ | wc -l
```

Derived sources:
- `CLAUDE.md` Project Overview: "N skills"
- `manifests/ork.json` — skill list length

### Agents

**Authoritative**: `src/agents/` — count `.md` files.

```bash
# Count agent files
ls src/agents/*.md | wc -l
```

Derived sources:
- `CLAUDE.md` Project Overview: "N agents"
- `manifests/ork.json` — agent list length

**Incorrect:**

```bash
# Counting from generated plugins/ — stale if build was interrupted
ls -d plugins/ork/skills/*/ | wc -l
```

**Correct:**

```bash
# Always count from src/ — the authoritative source
ls -d src/skills/*/ | wc -l
```

### Key Rules

- Never count `plugins/` — it's generated from `src/` and may be stale if build was interrupted
- Only `manifests/ork.json` exists in v7 — no alias manifests to compare
- Hook breakdown (global + agent-scoped + skill-scoped) must sum to the total count

## Where Counts Live

### Source of Truth (filesystem)

| What | Path | How to Count |
|------|------|-------------|
| Skills | `src/skills/*/` | Subdirectory count |
| Agents | `src/agents/*.md` | `.md` file count |
| Hooks | `src/hooks/hooks.json` → `.hooks[]` | Array length |

### Derived Counts (must stay in sync)

| File | Field | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project Overview line | "69 skills, 38 agents, 78 hooks" |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Version section | "55 entries (17 event types, 12 dispatchers, 9 native async)" |
| `src/hooks/hooks.json` | top-level `description` | May embed hook count |
| `manifests/ork.json` | `skills[]` length, `agents[]` length | Counted from arrays |

## Why Counts Drift

Counts in documentation and manifests must be updated manually after adding or removing components. Common drift scenarios:

1. **Added a skill** — `src/skills/` count increases, but `CLAUDE.md` and manifests may not be updated until `npm run build` is run and CLAUDE.md is manually edited.
2. **Added a hook** — `hooks.json` entry count increases, but the `description` field and CLAUDE.md still show the old count.
3. **Interrupted build** — `plugins/` is emptied at build start; if build fails mid-run, plugins are gone but src counts are fine.

## Hook Breakdown

CLAUDE.md tracks hooks with a breakdown: `N hooks (X global + Y agent-scoped + Z skill-scoped)`.

- **Global**: hooks that run on all Claude Code sessions
- **Agent-scoped**: hooks only active during named agent sessions
- **Skill-scoped**: hooks only active when a specific skill is running

The three numbers must sum to the total. The authoritative breakdown comes from `src/hooks/hooks.json` — each entry has a `scope` field or equivalent.
