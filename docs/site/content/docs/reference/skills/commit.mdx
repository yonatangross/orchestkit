# Smart Commit

Simple, validated commit creation. Run checks locally, no agents needed for standard commits.

## Quick Start

```bash
/commit
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Commit Safety Check

```bash
# CRITICAL: Verify we're not on dev/main
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$BRANCH" == "dev" || "$BRANCH" == "main" || "$BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "STOP! Cannot commit directly to $BRANCH"
  echo "Create a feature branch: git checkout -b issue/<number>-<description>"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Phase 2: Run Validation Locally

Run every check that CI runs:

```bash
# Backend (Python)
poetry run ruff format --check app/
poetry run ruff check app/
poetry run mypy app/

# Frontend (Node.js)
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Fix any failures before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Review Changes

```bash
git status
git diff --staged   # What will be committed
git diff            # Unstaged changes
```

### Phase 4: Stage and Commit

```bash
# Stage files
git add <files>
# Or all: git add .

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "<type>(#<issue>): <brief description>

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

# Verify
git log -1 --stat
```

## Commit Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code improvement |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `chore` | Build/deps/CI |

## Rules

1. **Run validation locally** - Don't spawn agents to run lint/test
2. **NO file creation** - Don't create MD files or documentation
3. **One logical change per commit** - Keep commits focused
4. **Reference issues** - Use `#123` format in commit message
5. **Subject line &lt; 72 chars** - Keep it concise

## Quick Commit

For trivial changes (typos, single-line fixes):

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "fix(#123): Fix typo in error message

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

- review-pr: Review changes before committing
- fix-issue: Fix issues and commit the fixes
- issue-progress-tracking: Auto-updates GitHub issues with commit progress

## Rules

Each category has individual rule files in `rules/` loaded on-demand:

| Category | Rule | Impact | Key Pattern |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Atomic Commits | `rules/atomic-commit.md` | CRITICAL | One logical change per commit, atomicity test |
| Commit Splitting | `rules/commit-splitting.md` | HIGH | `git add -p`, interactive staging, separation strategies |
| Conventional Format | `rules/conventional-format.md` | HIGH | type(scope): description, breaking changes |

**Total: 3 rules across 3 categories**

## Rules (3)

<Accordions type="multiple">

<Accordion title="Atomic Commit Rules — CRITICAL">


## Atomic Commit Rules

A commit is atomic when it contains exactly ONE logical change that can be understood, reviewed, and reverted independently.

### The Atomicity Test

A commit is atomic if ALL of these are true:

```
[x] Does ONE logical thing
[x] Leaves the codebase in a working state (tests pass)
[x] Commit message doesn't need "and" in the title
[x] Can be reverted independently without breaking other features
[x] A reviewer can understand the full change without external context
```

### Detection Heuristics

**Directory Spread** — Changes spanning unrelated directories signal mixed concerns:

```
# ATOMIC: Related files in same domain
src/auth/login.ts
src/auth/login.test.ts
src/auth/types.ts

# NOT ATOMIC: Unrelated directories
src/auth/login.ts        ← auth feature
src/billing/invoice.ts   ← billing feature
config/webpack.config.js ← build config
```

**Commit Type Mixing** — A single commit shouldn't mix types:

```
# NOT ATOMIC: feat + fix in one commit
feat: Add user dashboard
fix: Resolve login timeout     ← separate commit

# NOT ATOMIC: feat + chore in one commit
feat: Add API caching
chore: Update eslint config     ← separate commit
```

**File Count Threshold** — More than 10 staged files warrants inspection. Not always wrong, but should be verified:

```
# OK: 15 files, all test fixtures for one feature
tests/fixtures/user-*.json (15 files)

# NOT OK: 12 files across 6 unrelated modules
```

**"And" Test** — If describing the commit requires "and", it's two commits:

```
# Fails "and" test → split it
"Add user authentication AND fix logging format"

# Passes "and" test → atomic
"Add JWT token validation for login endpoint"
```

### Common Atomic Patterns

| Pattern | Files | Why Atomic |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Feature + its tests | `feature.ts` + `feature.test.ts` | Tests validate the feature |
| Migration + model update | `migration.sql` + `model.ts` | Schema change is one concern |
| Refactor across files | Multiple files, same pattern | One refactoring decision |
| Config change | `.env.example` + `config.ts` | One configuration concern |
| Dependency update | `package.json` + `package-lock.json` | One dependency decision |

### Common Non-Atomic Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Feature + unrelated fix | Two concerns | Two separate commits |
| Code change + formatting | Formatting is noise | Format first, then change |
| Multiple features | Can't revert independently | One commit per feature |
| Feature + config change | Different review concerns | Separate unless config IS the feature |

### Key Rules

- One logical change per commit — if you say "and", split it
- Tests belong with the code they test — same commit
- Formatting/linting changes are separate commits
- Database migrations go with the code that uses them
- Never mix feature work with unrelated refactoring

<Accordion title="Commit Splitting Strategies — HIGH">


## Commit Splitting Strategies

When you have mixed changes in your working directory, use these strategies to create atomic commits.

### Strategy 1: Interactive Staging (`git add -p`)

Stage changes hunk-by-hunk to separate concerns:

```bash
# Stage changes interactively
git add -p

# Options at each hunk:
# y - stage this hunk
# n - skip this hunk
# s - split into smaller hunks (if hunk has gaps)
# e - manually edit the hunk boundaries
# q - quit, leave remaining unstaged

# Review what's staged vs unstaged
git diff --staged    # Will be committed
git diff             # Won't be committed

# Commit the staged portion
git commit -m "feat(#123): Add user validation"

# Repeat for next logical change
git add -p
git commit -m "fix(#456): Resolve timeout in auth"
```

### Strategy 2: File-Based Splitting

When changes are in separate files, stage by file:

```bash
# Stage only auth-related files
git add src/auth/login.ts src/auth/login.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(#123): Add login validation"

# Stage only billing-related files
git add src/billing/invoice.ts src/billing/invoice.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(#124): Add invoice generation"
```

### Strategy 3: Stash-Based Splitting

For complex mixed changes, use stash to isolate:

```bash
# Stash everything
git stash

# Apply and stage only what you need
git stash pop
git add -p  # Stage only feature A
git stash   # Re-stash the rest
git commit -m "feat: Feature A"

# Recover remaining changes
git stash pop
git add -p  # Stage feature B
git commit -m "feat: Feature B"
```

### Strategy 4: Pre-Commit Formatting Split

Always format BEFORE making logical changes:

```bash
# Step 1: Format first (separate commit)
npx prettier --write src/
git add -A
git commit -m "style: Format files with prettier"

# Step 2: Now make your logical changes
# ... edit files ...
git add -p
git commit -m "feat(#123): Add user dashboard"
```

### When to Split

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `git diff --staged` shows > 10 files | Review if all related |
| Commit message needs "and" | Split into separate commits |
| Changes span > 3 unrelated directories | Split by directory/concern |
| Mix of feat + fix + chore | One commit per type |
| Formatting mixed with logic changes | Format first, then logic |

### Key Rules

- Use `git add -p` as the default — stage interactively, not `git add .`
- Format changes always go in their own commit
- Test files go with the code they test, not in separate commits
- When in doubt, split — smaller commits are always safer
- Each commit should pass tests independently

<Accordion title="Conventional Commit Format — HIGH">


## Conventional Commit Format

All commits must follow the Conventional Commits specification for automated tooling.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Types

| Type | When | Bumps |
|------|------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | — |
| `docs` | Documentation only | — |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests | — |
| `chore` | Build, deps, CI, tooling | — |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons | — |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | PATCH |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration | — |
| `build` | Build system changes | — |

### Scope

Optional, identifies the area of change:

```bash
# Issue reference (preferred)
feat(#123): Add user authentication

# Module name
fix(auth): Resolve token expiration

# No scope (acceptable for small changes)
chore: Update dependencies
```

### Breaking Changes

Use `!` after type/scope OR `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```bash
# With ! marker (bumps MAJOR)
feat(api)!: Change authentication endpoint structure

# With footer
feat(api): Change auth endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: /api/auth/login now requires email instead of username
```

### Title Rules

```
[x] Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
[x] No period at end
[x] < 72 characters (< 50 preferred)
[x] Lowercase after colon
[x] Meaningful — describes WHY, not just WHAT
```

**Incorrect:**
```
Fixed the bug.                          # Past tense, period, no type
feat: stuff                             # Vague
feat: Add user authentication and fix billing  # Two concerns
FEAT: Add Auth                          # Uppercase
```

**Correct:**
```
feat(#123): Add JWT token validation for login
fix(#456): Resolve race condition in payment processing
refactor: Extract database connection pool to shared module
```

### Body (Optional)

Use for context that doesn't fit in the title:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(#123): Add rate limiting to API endpoints

Applied token bucket algorithm with 100 req/min per user.
Redis-backed for distributed deployments.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Key Rules

- Type is mandatory — no untyped commits
- Scope with issue number when available (`#123`)
- Title &lt; 72 chars, imperative mood, no period
- One type per commit — if you need `feat` AND `fix`, make two commits
- Always include `Co-Authored-By` when Claude assists
- Breaking changes must use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
