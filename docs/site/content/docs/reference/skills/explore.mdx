# Codebase Exploration

Multi-angle codebase exploration using 3-5 parallel agents.

## Quick Start

```bash
/explore authentication
```

> **Opus 4.6**: Exploration agents use native adaptive thinking for deeper pattern recognition across large codebases.

---

## STEP 0: Verify User Intent with AskUserQuestion

**BEFORE creating tasks**, clarify what the user wants to explore:

```python
AskUserQuestion(
  questions=[{
    "question": "What aspect do you want to explore?",
    "header": "Focus",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Full exploration (Recommended)", "description": "Code structure + data flow + architecture + health assessment"},
      {"label": "Code structure only", "description": "Find files, classes, functions related to topic"},
      {"label": "Data flow", "description": "Trace how data moves through the system"},
      {"label": "Architecture patterns", "description": "Identify design patterns and integrations"},
      {"label": "Quick search", "description": "Just find relevant files, skip deep analysis"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
)
```

**Based on answer, adjust workflow:**
- **Full exploration**: All 8 phases, all parallel agents
- **Code structure only**: Skip phases 4-6 (health, dependencies, product)
- **Data flow**: Focus phase 3 agents on data tracing
- **Architecture patterns**: Focus on backend-system-architect agent
- **Quick search**: Skip to phase 1-2 only, return file list

---

## STEP 0b: Select Orchestration Mode

Choose **Agent Teams** (mesh — explorers share discoveries) or **Task tool** (star — all report to lead):

1. `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` → **Agent Teams mode**
2. Agent Teams unavailable → **Task tool mode** (default)
3. Otherwise: Full exploration with 4+ agents → recommend **Agent Teams**; Quick search or single-focus → **Task tool**

| Aspect | Task Tool | Agent Teams |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Discovery sharing | Lead synthesizes after all complete | Explorers share discoveries as they go |
| Cross-referencing | Lead connects dots | Data flow explorer alerts architecture explorer |
| Cost | ~150K tokens | ~400K tokens |
| Best for | Quick/focused searches | Deep full-codebase exploration |

> **Fallback:** If Agent Teams encounters issues, fall back to Task tool for remaining exploration.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Management is MANDATORY (CC 2.1.16)

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, create tasks to show progress:**

```python
# 1. Create main exploration task IMMEDIATELY
TaskCreate(
  subject="Explore: {topic}",
  description="Deep codebase exploration for {topic}",
  activeForm="Exploring {topic}"
)

# 2. Create subtasks for phases (8-phase process)
TaskCreate(subject="Initial file search", activeForm="Searching files")
TaskCreate(subject="Check knowledge graph", activeForm="Checking memory")
TaskCreate(subject="Launch exploration agents", activeForm="Dispatching explorers")
TaskCreate(subject="Assess code health (0-10)", activeForm="Assessing code health")
TaskCreate(subject="Map dependency hotspots", activeForm="Mapping dependencies")
TaskCreate(subject="Add product perspective", activeForm="Adding product context")
TaskCreate(subject="Generate exploration report", activeForm="Generating report")

# 3. Update status as you progress
TaskUpdate(taskId="2", status="in_progress")  # When starting
TaskUpdate(taskId="2", status="completed")    # When done
```

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Activities | Output |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **1. Initial Search** | Grep, Glob for matches | File locations |
| **2. Memory Check** | Search knowledge graph | Prior context |
| **3. Deep Exploration** | 4 parallel explorers | Multi-angle analysis |
| **4. Code Health Assessment** | Rate found code 0-10 | Quality scores |
| **5. Dependency Hotspot Map** | Identify coupling | Hotspot visualization |
| **6. Product Perspective** | Business context | Findability suggestions |
| **7. Report Generation** | Compile findings | Actionable report |

---

### Phase 1: Initial Search

```python
# PARALLEL - Quick searches
Grep(pattern="$ARGUMENTS", output_mode="files_with_matches")
Glob(pattern="**/*$ARGUMENTS*")
```

### Phase 2: Memory Check

```python
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="$ARGUMENTS")
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="architecture")
```

### Phase 3: Parallel Deep Exploration (4 Agents)

Launch 4 specialized explorers in ONE message with `run_in_background: true`:

```python
# PARALLEL - All 4 in ONE message
Task(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  prompt="""Code Structure: Find all files, classes, functions related to: $ARGUMENTS

  Scope: ONLY read files directly relevant to the topic. Do NOT explore the entire codebase.

  SUMMARY: End with: "RESULT: [N] files, [M] classes - [key location, e.g., 'src/auth/']"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
Task(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  prompt="""Data Flow: Trace entry points, processing, storage for: $ARGUMENTS

  Scope: ONLY read files directly relevant to the topic. Do NOT explore the entire codebase.

  SUMMARY: End with: "RESULT: [entry] → [processing] → [storage] - [N] hop flow"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
Task(
  subagent_type="backend-system-architect",
  prompt="""Backend Patterns: Analyze architecture patterns, integrations, dependencies for: $ARGUMENTS

  Scope: ONLY read files directly relevant to the topic. Do NOT explore the entire codebase.

  SUMMARY: End with: "RESULT: [pattern name] - [N] integrations, [M] dependencies"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
Task(
  subagent_type="frontend-ui-developer",
  prompt="""Frontend Analysis: Find components, state management, routes for: $ARGUMENTS

  Scope: ONLY read files directly relevant to the topic. Do NOT explore the entire codebase.

  SUMMARY: End with: "RESULT: [N] components, [state lib] - [key route]"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
```

**Explorer Roles:**
1. **Code Structure Explorer** - Files, classes, functions
2. **Data Flow Explorer** - Entry points, processing, storage
3. **Backend Architect** - Patterns, integration, dependencies
4. **Frontend Developer** - Components, state, routes

### Phase 3 — Agent Teams Alternative

In Agent Teams mode, form an exploration team where explorers share discoveries in real-time:

```python
TeamCreate(team_name="explore-{topic}", description="Explore {topic}")

Task(subagent_type="Explore", name="structure-explorer",
     team_name="explore-{topic}",
     prompt="""Find all files, classes, and functions related to: {topic}
     When you discover key entry points, message data-flow-explorer so they
     can trace data paths from those points.
     When you find backend patterns, message backend-explorer.
     When you find frontend components, message frontend-explorer.""")

Task(subagent_type="Explore", name="data-flow-explorer",
     team_name="explore-{topic}",
     prompt="""Trace entry points, processing, and storage for: {topic}
     When structure-explorer shares entry points, start tracing from those.
     When you discover cross-boundary data flows (frontend→backend or vice versa),
     message both backend-explorer and frontend-explorer.""")

Task(subagent_type="backend-system-architect", name="backend-explorer",
     team_name="explore-{topic}",
     prompt="""Analyze backend architecture patterns for: {topic}
     When structure-explorer or data-flow-explorer share backend findings,
     investigate deeper — API design, database schema, service patterns.
     Share integration points with frontend-explorer for consistency.""")

Task(subagent_type="frontend-ui-developer", name="frontend-explorer",
     team_name="explore-{topic}",
     prompt="""Analyze frontend components, state, and routes for: {topic}
     When structure-explorer shares component locations, investigate deeper.
     When backend-explorer shares API patterns, verify frontend alignment.
     Share component hierarchy with data-flow-explorer.""")
```

**Team teardown** after report generation:
```python
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="structure-explorer", content="Exploration complete")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="data-flow-explorer", content="Exploration complete")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="backend-explorer", content="Exploration complete")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="frontend-explorer", content="Exploration complete")
TeamDelete()
```

> **Fallback:** If team formation fails, use standard Phase 3 Task spawns above.

### Phase 4: AI System Exploration (If Applicable)

For AI/ML topics, add exploration of:
- LangGraph workflows
- Prompt templates
- RAG pipeline
- Caching strategies

### Phase 5: Code Health Assessment (NEW)

**Goal:** Rate found code quality 0-10 with specific dimensions.

```python
Task(
  subagent_type="code-quality-reviewer",
  prompt="""CODE HEALTH ASSESSMENT for files related to: $ARGUMENTS

  Rate each dimension 0-10:

  1. READABILITY (0-10)
     - Clear naming conventions?
     - Appropriate comments?
     - Logical organization?

  2. MAINTAINABILITY (0-10)
     - Single responsibility?
     - Low coupling?
     - Easy to modify?

  3. TESTABILITY (0-10)
     - Pure functions where possible?
     - Dependency injection?
     - Existing test coverage?

  4. COMPLEXITY (0-10, inverted: 10=simple, 0=complex)
     - Cyclomatic complexity?
     - Nesting depth?
     - Function length?

  5. DOCUMENTATION (0-10)
     - API docs present?
     - Usage examples?
     - Architecture notes?

  Output:
  {
    "overall_score": N.N,
    "dimensions": {
      "readability": N,
      "maintainability": N,
      "testability": N,
      "complexity": N,
      "documentation": N
    },
    "hotspots": ["file:line - issue"],
    "recommendations": ["improvement suggestion"]
  }

  SUMMARY: End with: "HEALTH: [N.N]/10 - [best dimension] strong, [worst dimension] needs work"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
```

### Phase 6: Dependency Hotspot Map (NEW)

**Goal:** Identify highly-coupled code and dependency bottlenecks.

```python
# Analyze imports and dependencies
Task(
  subagent_type="backend-system-architect",
  prompt="""DEPENDENCY HOTSPOT ANALYSIS for: $ARGUMENTS

  Analyze coupling and dependencies:

  1. IMPORT ANALYSIS
     - Which files import this code?
     - What does this code import?
     - Circular dependencies?

  2. COUPLING SCORE (0-10, 10=highly coupled)
     - How many files would break if this changes?
     - Fan-in (incoming dependencies)
     - Fan-out (outgoing dependencies)

  3. CHANGE IMPACT
     - Blast radius of modifications
     - Files that always change together

  4. HOTSPOT VISUALIZATION
     ```
     [Module A] --depends--> [Target] &lt;--depends-- [Module B]
                                |
                                v
                           [Module C]
     ```

  Output:
  {
    "coupling_score": N,
    "fan_in": N,
    "fan_out": N,
    "circular_deps": [],
    "change_impact": ["file - reason"],
    "hotspot_diagram": "ASCII diagram"
  }

  SUMMARY: End with: "COUPLING: [N]/10 - [N] incoming, [M] outgoing deps - [key concern]"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
```

### Phase 7: Product Perspective Agent (NEW)

**Goal:** Add business context and findability suggestions.

```python
Task(
  subagent_type="product-strategist",
  prompt="""PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE for: $ARGUMENTS

  Analyze from a product/business viewpoint:

  1. BUSINESS CONTEXT
     - What user problem does this code solve?
     - What feature/capability does it enable?
     - Who are the users of this code?

  2. FINDABILITY SUGGESTIONS
     - Better naming for discoverability?
     - Missing documentation entry points?
     - Where should someone look first?

  3. KNOWLEDGE GAPS
     - What context is missing for new developers?
     - What tribal knowledge exists?
     - What should be documented?

  4. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION
     - Keywords someone might use to find this
     - Alternative terms for the same concept
     - Related concepts to cross-reference

  Output:
  {
    "business_purpose": "description",
    "primary_users": ["user type"],
    "findability_issues": ["issue - suggestion"],
    "recommended_entry_points": ["file - why start here"],
    "search_keywords": ["keyword"],
    "documentation_gaps": ["gap"]
  }

  SUMMARY: End with: "FINDABILITY: [N] issues - start at [recommended entry point]"
  """,
  run_in_background=True,
  max_turns=25
)
```

<Accordion title="Dependency Analysis">

# Dependency Analysis

Identify coupling hotspots and dependency patterns in codebases.

## Fan-In / Fan-Out Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Implication |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Fan-In** | Files that import this module | High = many dependents, changes risky |
| **Fan-Out** | Modules this file imports | High = many dependencies, fragile |
| **Instability** | Fan-Out / (Fan-In + Fan-Out) | 0 = stable, 1 = unstable |

**Ideal Patterns:**
- Core utilities: High fan-in, low fan-out (stable)
- Feature modules: Low fan-in, moderate fan-out
- Entry points: Low fan-in, high fan-out

---

## Hotspot Identification

### High-Risk Indicators

| Pattern | Risk | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Fan-in > 10 | Blast radius large | Add interface/abstraction |
| Fan-out > 8 | Too many dependencies | Extract facades |
| Instability = 1, Fan-in > 5 | Unstable core | Stabilize or decouple |

### Coupling Score Formula

```
coupling_score = min(10, (fan_in + fan_out) / 3)
```

- 0-3: Low coupling (healthy)
- 4-6: Moderate coupling (monitor)
- 7-10: High coupling (refactor)

---

## Circular Dependency Detection

**Signs of Circular Dependencies:**
1. Import errors at runtime
2. Mysterious `None` values
3. Files that always change together
4. Cannot extract to separate package

**Detection Approach:**
```
A imports B
B imports C
C imports A  <- CIRCULAR
```

**Resolution Strategies:**
1. Extract shared interface
2. Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions)
3. Merge tightly coupled modules
4. Event-driven decoupling

---

## Change Impact Analysis

**Questions to Answer:**
1. If I modify this file, what breaks?
2. Which files always change together?
3. What is the blast radius of a refactor?

**Measuring Impact:**
- **Direct Impact**: Files importing the changed module
- **Transitive Impact**: Files importing those files
- **Co-Change Frequency**: Git history of files changed together

**High Impact Indicators:**
- > 5 direct dependents
- > 20 transitive dependents
- > 80% co-change frequency with another file

<Accordion title="Findability Patterns">

# Findability Patterns

Improve code discoverability for developers exploring the codebase.

## Naming Conventions for Searchability

| Pattern | Example | Searchability |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Domain prefix | `auth_login()`, `auth_logout()` | Grep "auth_" finds all |
| Feature suffix | `UserService`, `UserRepository` | Grep "User" finds related |
| Action verbs | `create_user`, `delete_order` | Grep "create_" finds patterns |
| Consistent pluralization | `users/`, `orders/` | Predictable directory names |

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Abbreviations: `usr`, `mgr`, `svc` (hard to search)
- Generic names: `utils.py`, `helpers.js` (too broad)
- Inconsistent casing: `getUserData`, `get_user_data`

---

## Documentation Placement

| Location | Purpose | Findability |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `README.md` in directory | Module overview | First thing developers see |
| Inline docstrings | Function behavior | IDE tooltips, grep |
| `docs/architecture/` | System design | High-level understanding |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Development guide | Onboarding entry |

**Entry Point Strategy:**
1. Every directory should have a README or index
2. Complex modules need architecture diagrams
3. Public APIs need usage examples
4. Workflows need sequence diagrams

---

## Module Organization

### Vertical Slice Architecture

```
features/
  auth/
    api.py          # Entry point
    service.py      # Business logic
    repository.py   # Data access
    models.py       # Domain models
    tests/          # Co-located tests
```

**Benefits:**
- Related code together
- Easy to find all auth-related files
- Clear boundaries

### Horizontal Layer Architecture

```
api/
  auth.py
  users.py
services/
  auth.py
  users.py
```

**Benefits:**
- Technical cohesion
- Easier cross-cutting concerns

---

## Improving Discoverability

### Quick Wins

1. **Add index files**: Export public API from `__init__.py` or `index.ts`
2. **Use consistent prefixes**: `handle_`, `on_`, `create_`, `get_`
3. **Create README per directory**: Brief purpose + key files
4. **Tag with keywords**: Add searchable comments for concepts

### Search Optimization

```python
# Keywords: authentication, login, JWT, OAuth, session
# See also: user_service.py, token_handler.py
```

**Metadata in Files:**
- Related files cross-reference
- Alternative terms for the concept
- Links to documentation
