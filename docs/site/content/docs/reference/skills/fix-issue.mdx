# Fix Issue

Systematic issue resolution with hypothesis-based root cause analysis, similar issue detection, and prevention recommendations.

## Quick Start

```bash
/fix-issue 123
/fix-issue 456
```

> **Opus 4.6**: Root cause analysis uses native adaptive thinking. Dynamic token budgets scale with context window for thorough investigation.

---

## STEP 0: Verify User Intent with AskUserQuestion

**BEFORE creating tasks**, clarify fix approach:

```python
AskUserQuestion(
  questions=[{
    "question": "What approach for this fix?",
    "header": "Approach",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Proper fix (Recommended)", "description": "Full RCA, tests, prevention recommendations"},
      {"label": "Quick fix", "description": "Minimal fix to resolve the immediate issue"},
      {"label": "Investigate first", "description": "Understand the issue before deciding on approach"},
      {"label": "Hotfix", "description": "Emergency patch, minimal testing"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
)
```

**Based on answer, adjust workflow:**
- **Proper fix**: All 11 phases, parallel agents for RCA
- **Quick fix**: Skip phases 8-10 (prevention, runbook, lessons)
- **Investigate first**: Only phases 1-4 (understand, search, hypotheses, analyze)
- **Hotfix**: Minimal phases, skip similar issue search

---

## STEP 0b: Select Orchestration Mode

Choose **Agent Teams** (mesh — RCA agents share hypotheses) or **Task tool** (star — all report to lead):

1. `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` → **Agent Teams mode**
2. Agent Teams unavailable → **Task tool mode** (default)
3. Otherwise: Complex cross-cutting bugs (backend + frontend + tests involved) → recommend **Agent Teams**; Focused bugs (single domain) → **Task tool**

| Aspect | Task Tool | Agent Teams |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Hypothesis sharing | Lead relays between agents | Investigators share hypotheses in real-time |
| Conflicting evidence | Lead resolves | Investigators debate directly |
| Cost | ~250K tokens | ~600K tokens |
| Best for | Single-domain bugs | Cross-cutting bugs with multiple hypotheses |

> **Fallback:** If Agent Teams encounters issues, fall back to Task tool for remaining investigation.

---

## Task Management (CC 2.1.16)

```python
# Create main fix task
TaskCreate(
  subject="Fix issue #{number}",
  description="Systematic issue resolution with hypothesis-based RCA",
  activeForm="Fixing issue #{number}"
)

# Create subtasks for 11-phase process
phases = ["Understand issue", "Search similar issues", "Form hypotheses",
          "Analyze root cause", "Design fix", "Implement fix", "Validate fix",
          "Generate prevention", "Create runbook", "Capture lessons", "Commit and PR"]
for phase in phases:
    TaskCreate(subject=phase, activeForm=f"{phase}ing")
```

---

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Activities | Output |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **1. Understand Issue** | Read GitHub issue details | Problem statement |
| **2. Similar Issue Detection** | Search for related past issues | Related issues list |
| **3. Hypothesis Formation** | Form hypotheses with confidence scores | Ranked hypotheses |
| **4. Root Cause Analysis** | 5 parallel agents investigate | Confirmed root cause |
| **5. Fix Design** | Design approach based on RCA | Fix specification |
| **6. Implementation** | Apply fix with tests | Working code |
| **7. Validation** | Verify fix resolves issue | Evidence |
| **8. Prevention** | How to prevent recurrence | Prevention plan |
| **9. Runbook** | Create/update runbook entry | Runbook |
| **10. Lessons Learned** | Capture knowledge | Persisted learnings |
| **11. Commit and PR** | Create PR with fix | Merged PR |

---

## Phase 1: Understand the Issue

```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels,assignees,comments
gh pr list --search "issue:$ARGUMENTS"
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --comments
```

---

## Phase 2: Similar Issue Detection

See [Similar Issue Search](references/similar-issue-search.md) for patterns.

```bash
gh issue list --search "[key error message]" --state all
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="issue [error type] fix")
```

| Similar Issue | Similarity | Status | Relevant? |
|---------------|------------|--------|-----------|
| #101 | 85% | Closed | Yes |

**Determine:** Regression? Variant? New issue?

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Formation

See [Hypothesis-Based RCA](references/hypothesis-rca.md) for confidence scoring.

```markdown
## Hypothesis 1: [Brief name]
**Confidence:** [0-100]%
**Description:** [What might cause the issue]
**Test:** [How to verify]
```

| Confidence | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 90-100% | Near certain |
| 70-89% | Highly likely |
| 50-69% | Probable |
| 30-49% | Possible |
| 0-29% | Unlikely |

---

## Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis (5 Agents)

Launch ALL 5 agents in parallel with `run_in_background=True` and `max_turns=25`:

1. **debug-investigator**: Root cause tracing
2. **debug-investigator**: Impact analysis
3. **backend-system-architect**: Backend fix design
4. **frontend-ui-developer**: Frontend fix design
5. **test-generator**: Test requirements

Each agent outputs structured JSON with findings and SUMMARY line.

### Phase 4 — Agent Teams Alternative

In Agent Teams mode, form an investigation team where RCA agents share hypotheses and evidence in real-time:

```python
TeamCreate(team_name="fix-issue-{number}", description="RCA for issue #{number}")

Task(subagent_type="debug-investigator", name="root-cause-tracer",
     team_name="fix-issue-{number}",
     prompt="""Trace the root cause for issue #{number}: {issue description}
     Hypotheses: {hypothesis list from Phase 3}
     Test each hypothesis. When you find evidence supporting or refuting a hypothesis,
     message impact-analyst and the relevant domain expert (backend-expert or frontend-expert).
     If you find conflicting evidence, share it with ALL teammates for debate.""")

Task(subagent_type="debug-investigator", name="impact-analyst",
     team_name="fix-issue-{number}",
     prompt="""Analyze the impact and blast radius for issue #{number}.
     When root-cause-tracer shares evidence, assess how many code paths are affected.
     Message test-planner with affected paths so they can plan regression tests.
     If the impact is larger than expected, message the lead immediately.""")

Task(subagent_type="backend-system-architect", name="backend-expert",
     team_name="fix-issue-{number}",
     prompt="""Investigate backend aspects of issue #{number}.
     When root-cause-tracer shares backend-related hypotheses, design the fix approach.
     Message frontend-expert if the fix affects API contracts.
     Share fix design with test-planner for test requirements.""")

Task(subagent_type="frontend-ui-developer", name="frontend-expert",
     team_name="fix-issue-{number}",
     prompt="""Investigate frontend aspects of issue #{number}.
     When root-cause-tracer shares frontend-related hypotheses, design the fix approach.
     If backend-expert changes API contracts, adapt the frontend fix accordingly.
     Share component changes with test-planner.""")

Task(subagent_type="test-generator", name="test-planner",
     team_name="fix-issue-{number}",
     prompt="""Plan regression tests for issue #{number}.
     When root-cause-tracer confirms the root cause, write a failing test that reproduces it.
     When backend-expert or frontend-expert share fix designs, plan verification tests.
     Start with the regression test BEFORE the fix is applied (TDD approach).""")
```

**Team teardown** after fix is implemented and validated:
```python
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="root-cause-tracer", content="Fix validated")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="impact-analyst", content="Fix validated")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="backend-expert", content="Fix validated")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="frontend-expert", content="Fix validated")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="test-planner", content="Fix validated")
TeamDelete()
```

> **Fallback:** If team formation fails, use standard Phase 4 Task spawns above.

## Phase 5: Fix Design

```markdown
## Fix Design for Issue #$ARGUMENTS

### Root Cause (Confirmed)
[Description]

### Proposed Fix
[Approach]

### Files to Modify
| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| [file] | MODIFY | [why] |

### Risks
- [Risk 1]

### Rollback Plan
[How to revert]
```

---

## Phase 6: Implementation

### CRITICAL: Feature Branch Required

**NEVER commit directly to main or dev.** Always create a feature branch:

```bash
# Determine base branch
BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')

# Create feature branch (MANDATORY)
git checkout $BASE_BRANCH && git pull origin $BASE_BRANCH
git checkout -b issue/$ARGUMENTS-fix
```

### CRITICAL: Regression Test Required

**A fix without a test is incomplete.** Add test BEFORE implementing fix:

```bash
# 1. Write test that reproduces the bug (should FAIL)
# 2. Implement the fix
# 3. Verify test now PASSES
```

**Guidelines:**
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Add proper error handling
- Add regression test FIRST (MANDATORY)
- DO NOT over-engineer
- DO NOT commit directly to protected branches

---

## Phase 7: Validation

```bash
# Backend
poetry run ruff format --check app/
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short

# Frontend
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test
```

---

## Phase 8: Prevention Recommendations

**CRITICAL: Prevention must include at least one of:**
1. **Automated test** - CI catches similar issues (PREFERRED)
2. **Validation rule** - Schema/lint rule prevents bad state
3. **Process check** - Review checklist item

See [Prevention Patterns](references/prevention-patterns.md) for full template.

| Category | Examples | Effectiveness |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Automated test** | Unit/integration test in CI | HIGH - catches before merge |
| **Validation rule** | Schema check, lint rule | HIGH - catches on save/commit |
| Architecture | Better error boundaries | MEDIUM |
| Process | Review checklist item | LOW - human-dependent |

---

## Phase 9: Runbook Generation

```markdown
# Runbook: [Issue Type]

## Symptoms
- [Observable symptom]

## Diagnosis Steps
1. Check [X] by running: `[command]`

## Resolution Steps
1. [Step 1]

## Prevention
- [How to prevent]
```

Store in memory for future reference.

---

## Phase 10: Lessons Learned

```python
mcp__memory__create_entities(entities=[{
  "name": "lessons-issue-$ARGUMENTS",
  "entityType": "LessonsLearned",
  "observations": [
    "root_cause: [brief]",
    "key_learning: [most important]",
    "prevention: [recommendation]"
  ]
}])
```

---

## Phase 11: Commit and PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix(#$ARGUMENTS): [Brief description]

Root cause: [one line]
Prevention: [recommendation]"

git push -u origin issue/$ARGUMENTS-fix
gh pr create --base dev --title "fix(#$ARGUMENTS): [description]"
```

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Feature branch | MANDATORY | Never commit to main/dev directly |
| Regression test | MANDATORY | Fix without test is incomplete |
| Hypothesis confidence | 0-100% scale | Quantifies certainty |
| Similar issue search | Before hypothesis | Leverage past solutions |
| Prevention analysis | Mandatory phase | Break recurring issue cycle |
| Runbook generation | Template-based | Consistent documentation |

## CC 2.1.27+ Enhancements

### Session Resume with PR Context

When you create a PR for the fix, the session is automatically linked:

```bash
# Later: Resume with full PR context
claude --from-pr 789
```

### Task Metrics (CC 2.1.30)

Track RCA efficiency across the 5 parallel agents:

```markdown
## Phase 4 Metrics (Root Cause Analysis)
| Agent | Tokens | Tools | Duration |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| debug-investigator #1 | 520 | 12 | 18s |
| debug-investigator #2 | 480 | 10 | 15s |
| backend-system-architect | 390 | 8 | 12s |

**Root cause found in:** 45s total
```

### Tool Guidance (CC 2.1.31)

When investigating root cause:

| Task | Use | Avoid |
|------|-----|-------|
| Read logs/files | `Read(file_path=...)` | `bash cat` |
| Search for errors | `Grep(pattern="ERROR")` | `bash grep` |
| Find affected files | `Glob(pattern="**/*.py")` | `bash find` |
| Check git history | `Bash git log/diff` | (git needs bash) |

### Session Resume Hints (CC 2.1.31)

Before ending fix sessions, capture investigation context:

```bash
/ork:remember Issue #$ARGUMENTS RCA findings:
  Root cause: [one line]
  Confirmed by: [key evidence]
  Fix status: [implemented/pending]
  Prevention: [recommendation]
```

Resume later:
```bash
claude                              # Shows resume hint
/ork:memory search "issue $ARGUMENTS"  # Loads your findings
```

## Rules (3)

<Accordions type="multiple">

<Accordion title="Fault Tree Analysis — MEDIUM">


## Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

Top-down, deductive analysis mapping all paths to a failure using boolean logic (AND/OR gates). Best for critical systems and exhaustive failure analysis.

### FTA Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| TOP | Top event — the failure being analyzed |
| AND | All inputs must occur for output |
| OR | Any input causes output |
| Basic Event | Root cause (leaf node) |
| Undeveloped | Needs further analysis |

### Example: Authentication Failure

```
                USER CANNOT
                AUTHENTICATE
                     |
                   [OR]
        +------------+------------+
        |            |            |
    Invalid      Auth Service   Account
   Credentials     Down         Locked
        |            |
      [OR]         [OR]
    +---+---+    +---+---+
    |   |   |    |   |   |
   Wrong Expired Token DB  Redis External
   Pass  Token  Invalid Down Down  Auth
```

### Building a Fault Tree

1. **Define top event** — the failure to analyze
2. **Ask "what causes this?"** — list immediate causes
3. **Classify as AND/OR** — do ALL causes need to happen, or ANY one?
4. **Decompose each cause** — repeat until reaching basic events
5. **Identify minimal cut sets** — smallest combinations that cause failure
6. **Prioritize by probability** — most likely paths first

### Minimal Cut Sets

The smallest set of basic events that together cause the top event:

```
Top: User Cannot Authenticate (OR gate)
  Cut Set 1: {Wrong Password}         — single point of failure
  Cut Set 2: {Expired Token}          — single point of failure
  Cut Set 3: {DB Down}                — single point of failure
  Cut Set 4: {Account Locked}         — single point of failure
```

Single-event cut sets indicate **no redundancy** — add defense-in-depth.

### When to Use FTA

| Scenario | Use FTA? |
|----------|----------|
| Safety-critical system failure | Yes |
| Need exhaustive failure path mapping | Yes |
| Complex multi-component failure | Yes |
| Simple linear bug | No — use 5 Whys |
| Multiple contributing factors | Maybe — Fishbone first |
| Regulatory compliance analysis | Yes |
| Post-incident for serious outages | Yes |

### Key Rules

- Start from the **top event** (failure) and work **downward**
- Every gate must be classified as **AND** (all required) or **OR** (any sufficient)
- Decompose until reaching **basic events** (actionable root causes)
- Identify **minimal cut sets** to find the most vulnerable paths
- Single-event cut sets indicate **missing redundancy**
- Use for **critical systems** where exhaustive analysis is justified


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa) — MEDIUM">


## Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

Visualize multiple potential causes organized by category. Best for problems with several contributing factors.

### Software-Specific Categories

```
                    +-------------+
          Code -----+             |
                    |             |
 Infrastructure ----+             +---- BUG/INCIDENT
                    |             |
   Dependencies ----+             |
                    |             |
   Configuration ---+             |
                    |             |
        Process ----+             |
                    |             |
        People -----+             |
                    +-------------+
```

### Example: API Latency Spike

| Category | Potential Causes |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Code** | N+1 query, missing index, sync blocking call |
| **Infrastructure** | DB connection pool exhausted, network saturation, insufficient RAM |
| **Dependencies** | External API slow, Redis timeout, CDN cache miss |
| **Configuration** | Wrong pool size, missing timeout, debug logging on |
| **Process** | No load testing, no perf regression CI |
| **People** | Unfamiliarity with query optimizer, missing review |

### Fishbone Process

1. **Define the problem** clearly (the fish head)
2. **Identify major categories** (the bones) — use software categories above
3. **Brainstorm causes** for each category
4. **Analyze relationships** between causes across categories
5. **Prioritize** most likely root causes by evidence
6. **Verify** with data, metrics, or targeted testing
7. **Take action** on confirmed causes

### When to Use Fishbone

| Scenario | Use Fishbone? |
|----------|---------------|
| Multiple things went wrong | Yes |
| Problem has one clear cause | No — use 5 Whys |
| Team brainstorming session | Yes |
| Safety-critical failure analysis | No — use Fault Tree |
| Recurring issue with no clear pattern | Yes |

### Key Rules

- Use **software-specific categories** (Code, Infrastructure, Dependencies, Configuration, Process, People)
- Brainstorm causes per category **before** analyzing relationships
- Look for **cross-category interactions** (e.g., code + config)
- **Prioritize by evidence**, not by assumption
- Verify top candidates with **data or experiments** before committing to a fix


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5 Whys Technique — HIGH">


## 5 Whys Technique

Iteratively ask "why" to drill down from symptom to root cause. Simple, fast, and effective for linear causal chains.

### Process

```
Problem Statement: [Clear description of the issue]
    |
    v
Why #1: [First level cause]
    |
    v
Why #2: [Deeper cause]
    |
    v
Why #3: [Even deeper]
    |
    v
Why #4: [Getting to root]
    |
    v
Why #5: [Root cause identified]
    |
    v
Action: [Fix that addresses root cause]
```

### Example: Production Outage

```markdown
**Problem:** Website was down for 2 hours

**Why 1:** The application server ran out of memory and crashed.
**Why 2:** A memory leak in the image processing service accumulated over time.
**Why 3:** The service wasn't releasing image buffers after processing.
**Why 4:** The cleanup code had a bug introduced in last week's release.
**Why 5:** We don't have automated memory leak detection in our test suite.

**Root Cause:** Missing automated memory leak testing
**Action:** Add memory profiling to CI pipeline, add cleanup tests
```

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Base answers on evidence | Guess or assume |
| Stay focused on one causal chain | Branch too early |
| Keep asking until actionable | Stop at symptoms |
| Involve people closest to issue | Assign blame |
| Document your reasoning | Skip steps |

### When 5 Whys Falls Short

- **Multiple contributing factors** — use Fishbone diagram instead
- **Complex system interactions** — use Fault Tree Analysis
- **Organizational/process issues** — needs broader systemic analysis
- **Concurrent failures** — 5 Whys assumes linear causation

### Key Rules

- Always start with a **clear, specific problem statement**
- Each "why" must be **supported by evidence** (logs, metrics, code)
- Stop when you reach an **actionable root cause** (not always exactly 5)
- The fix should address the **root cause**, not the symptom
- Document the full chain for **knowledge sharing**

# Hypothesis-Based Root Cause Analysis

Scientific method for identifying root causes with quantified confidence.

## The Scientific Method for RCA

```
1. Observe symptoms
2. Form hypotheses
3. Gather evidence
4. Test hypotheses
5. Confirm or reject
6. Repeat until root cause found
```

## Hypothesis Template

```markdown
## Hypothesis: [Brief name]
**Confidence:** [0-100]%

**Description:**
[What might be causing the issue]

**Evidence For:**
- [Supporting evidence 1]
- [Supporting evidence 2]

**Evidence Against:**
- [Contradicting evidence 1]

**Test Plan:**
1. [Step to verify/refute]
2. [Expected outcome if true]
```

## Confidence Score Guidelines

| Score | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 90-100% | Near certain | Reproduction + multiple strong evidence |
| 70-89% | Highly likely | Clear evidence, logical chain |
| 50-69% | Probable | Some evidence, plausible mechanism |
| 30-49% | Possible | Limited evidence, needs investigation |
| 0-29% | Unlikely | Weak evidence, backup hypothesis |

## Evidence Classification

| Type | Weight | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Reproduction** | +30% | Consistent reproduction steps |
| **Code trace** | +20% | Stack trace to specific line |
| **Timing correlation** | +15% | Issue appeared after deployment X |
| **Log evidence** | +15% | Error messages match hypothesis |
| **Similar patterns** | +10% | Same error in related code |
| **User report** | +5% | Consistent user descriptions |

## Contradicting Evidence

| Evidence | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Hypothesis disproven by test | -40% |
| Works in same conditions | -25% |
| Unrelated timing | -15% |
| No supporting logs | -10% |

## Multiple Hypothesis Comparison

```markdown
| Hypothesis | Initial | After Test | Status |
|------------|---------|------------|--------|
| Race condition | 65% | 85% | INVESTIGATING |
| Null reference | 40% | 15% | REJECTED |
| Cache stale | 30% | 30% | ON HOLD |
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with 3+ hypotheses** - Avoid tunnel vision
2. **Test highest confidence first** - Efficient investigation
3. **Update scores after each test** - Track progress
4. **Document rejected hypotheses** - Prevent repeated investigation
5. **Look for evidence against** - Avoid confirmation bias

# Prevention Patterns

Strategies to prevent issue recurrence by category.

## Code-Level Prevention

| Issue Type | Prevention Pattern |
|------------|-------------------|
| Null/undefined | Optional chaining, nullish coalescing |
| Type errors | Strict TypeScript, runtime validation |
| Input validation | Zod schemas at boundaries |
| Error handling | Result types, explicit error states |
| Race conditions | Locks, atomic operations, idempotency |

## Stack Trace Similarity Matching

Match by:
1. **Exception type** - Same error class
2. **File/line** - Same code location
3. **Call stack depth** - Similar execution path
4. **Error message pattern** - Regex match on message

## Similarity Assessment Criteria

| Factor | Weight | High Match |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Same exception type | 30% | Exact match |
| Same file | 25% | Same file involved |
| Similar error message | 20% | >80% string similarity |
| Same component | 15% | Same service/module |
| Recent (&lt; 30 days) | 10% | Recently resolved |

## When to Reuse vs Investigate Fresh

**Reuse Previous Solution When:**
- Similarity > 80%
- Same root cause confirmed
- Fix is still applicable
- No code changes since fix

**Investigate Fresh When:**
- Similarity &lt; 60%
- Context has changed significantly
- Previous fix may be incomplete
- New dependencies involved

## Issue Classification

| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Regression** | Same issue, fix reverted or bypassed |
| **Variant** | Similar pattern, different trigger |
| **New** | No similar issues found |
