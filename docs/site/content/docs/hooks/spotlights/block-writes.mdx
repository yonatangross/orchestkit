> Prevents Write, Edit, MultiEdit, and NotebookEdit operations for agents that should only investigate and report --- never modify code.

## When It Fires

**Event:** PreToolUse · **Matcher:** `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit` · **Scope:** Agent-specific

This hook is registered in hooks.json with agent-specific matchers, so it only fires for designated read-only agents.

## What It Does

When a read-only agent attempts any write operation, the hook returns a hard denial. Claude sees a message identifying the agent and explaining that it is read-only:

```
BLOCKED: Agent 'debug-investigator' is read-only.
Write/Edit operations are not permitted.
This agent investigates and reports - it does not modify code.
```

The agent name is read from the `CLAUDE_AGENT_ID` environment variable. All non-write tools (Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, etc.) are allowed through.

## Agents Using This Hook

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `debug-investigator` | Investigates bugs without modifying code |
| `code-quality-reviewer` | Reviews code quality, reports findings only |
| `ux-researcher` | Analyzes UX patterns, no code changes |
| `market-intelligence` | Gathers market/competitive intelligence |
| `system-design-reviewer` | Reviews architecture decisions |

## Blocked Tools

The following tool names are intercepted and denied:

- **Write** --- creating new files
- **Edit** --- modifying existing files
- **MultiEdit** --- batch file modifications
- **NotebookEdit** --- Jupyter notebook cell edits

## Configuration

This hook has no user-configurable options. To change which agents are read-only, modify the agent-scoped hook entries in `hooks.json`.
