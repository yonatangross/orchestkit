## What Are Command Skills?

Command skills are the 23 skills with `user-invocable: true` in their frontmatter. You trigger them by typing `/ork:skill-name` in Claude Code. Each one is a structured workflow that guides Claude through a multi-step process, often spawning parallel agents and pulling in reference skills automatically.

Command skills differ from reference skills in three ways:

1. **You invoke them explicitly** with the `/ork:` prefix.
2. **They define workflows**, not just knowledge -- step-by-step processes with decision points.
3. **They compose other skills** via the `skills:` frontmatter field, pulling in reference skills as needed.

## Implementation and Development

These commands handle the core development cycle: building features, fixing bugs, and managing code quality.

| Command | Description | Complexity | Example |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/ork:implement` | Full-power feature implementation with parallel subagents. Asks for scope (full-stack, backend-only, frontend-only, quick prototype) and constraints before starting. | medium | `/ork:implement user authentication` |
| `/ork:fix-issue` | Systematic GitHub issue resolution with hypothesis-based root cause analysis, similar issue detection, and prevention recommendations. | medium | `/ork:fix-issue 123` |
| `/ork:verify` | Comprehensive verification with parallel test agents. Validates implementations across unit tests, integration tests, security, and type safety. | low | `/ork:verify` |
| `/ork:explore` | Deep codebase exploration with parallel agents. Maps architecture, discovers patterns, generates ASCII diagrams, and produces health assessments. | low | `/ork:explore` |
| `/ork:brainstorming` | Design exploration with parallel agents. Generates ideas, compares alternatives, and produces structured recommendations. | medium | `/ork:brainstorming real-time notifications` |
| `/ork:assess` | Rates quality 0-10 with structured pros/cons analysis. Works on code, designs, approaches, or any artifact. | low | `/ork:assess this API design` |
| `/ork:assess-complexity` | Assesses task complexity with codebase metrics. Determines if a task needs breakdown into subtasks. | medium | `/ork:assess-complexity add payment processing` |

---

## Git and GitHub

Commands for version control and pull request workflows.

| Command | Description | Complexity | Example |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/ork:commit` | Creates commits with conventional format and validation. Analyzes staged changes, generates a message, and runs pre-commit checks. | low | `/ork:commit` |
| `/ork:create-pr` | Creates GitHub pull requests with validation. Runs security scanning, code review, and type checking before opening the PR. | low | `/ork:create-pr` |
| `/ork:review-pr` | PR review with parallel specialized agents. Checks security, test coverage, type safety, and code quality simultaneously. | medium | `/ork:review-pr 456` |
| `/ork:git-recovery` | Recovery from git mistakes. Guides you through undoing commits, recovering branches, or fixing history using reflog. | medium | `/ork:git-recovery` |

---

## Memory and Knowledge

Commands for storing and retrieving decisions, patterns, and context across sessions.

| Command | Description | Complexity | Example |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/ork:remember` | Stores decisions and patterns in the knowledge graph. Supports `--success`, `--failed`, `--mem0`, and `--agent` flags for categorization. | low | `/ork:remember --success cursor pagination scales well` |
| `/ork:memory` | Read-side memory operations: search, load, sync, history, and visualization. Subcommands: `search`, `load`, `sync`, `history`, `viz`, `status`. | low | `/ork:memory search "pagination"` |

---

## Plugin Management

Commands for managing OrchestKit itself -- health checks, configuration, skill evolution, and feedback.

| Command | Description | Complexity | Example |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/ork:doctor` | OrchestKit health diagnostics. Validates permissions, hooks, skills, agents, and memory system status. | low | `/ork:doctor` |
| `/ork:configure` | Configures OrchestKit settings. Interactive wizard for MCP servers, plugin options, and preferences. | low | `/ork:configure` |
| `/ork:help` | OrchestKit skill directory. Lists available skills grouped by category with descriptions. | low | `/ork:help` |
| `/ork:feedback` | Manages OrchestKit feedback system. Submit feedback or view usage analytics with privacy controls. | low | `/ork:feedback` |
| `/ork:skill-evolution` | Evolves skills based on usage patterns. Analyzes skill effectiveness and suggests improvements or rollbacks. | medium | `/ork:skill-evolution` |

---

## Specialized Workflows

Commands for specific domains -- data curation, parallel development, competitive intelligence, platform upgrades, and video production.

| Command | Description | Complexity | Example |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/ork:add-golden` | Adds documents to golden dataset with validation. Includes quality scoring and bias detection for test data curation. | medium | `/ork:add-golden` |
| `/ork:worktree-coordination` | Coordinates multiple Claude instances across git worktrees. Manages locking for parallel development. | low | `/ork:worktree-coordination` |
| `/ork:competitive-monitoring` | Tracks competitor page changes over time. Captures snapshots, detects diffs, and alerts on significant changes. Supports Tavily for URL discovery. | medium | `/ork:competitive-monitoring` |
| `/ork:upgrade-assessment` | Assesses platform upgrade readiness for Claude model and CC version changes. Full compatibility and migration analysis. | max | `/ork:upgrade-assessment` |
| `/ork:demo-producer` | Creates polished demo videos for skills, tutorials, and CLI demonstrations. Orchestrates recording, narration, and composition. | low | `/ork:demo-producer` |

## How Command Skills Compose Reference Skills

Every command skill lists reference skills in its frontmatter `skills:` field. When you invoke the command, those reference skills are automatically loaded into context. For example, `/ork:implement` pulls in:

```yaml
skills:
  - api-design-framework
  - react-server-components-framework
  - type-safety-validation
  - unit-testing
  - integration-testing
  - explore
  - verify
  - memory
  - worktree-coordination
```

This means you do not need to remember which reference skills exist. The command skill knows what knowledge it needs and loads it automatically.

## Invocation Patterns

### Basic invocation

```
/ork:implement user authentication with OAuth
```

### With GitHub issue reference

```
/ork:fix-issue 123
```

### With flags (memory commands)

```
/ork:remember --success --category database pgvector handles 10M vectors well
/ork:memory search --mem0 "caching strategy"
```

### Chaining commands in a session

```
/ork:explore                          # Understand the codebase
/ork:implement search feature         # Build the feature
/ork:verify                           # Validate the implementation
/ork:commit                           # Commit the changes
/ork:create-pr                        # Open a pull request
```
