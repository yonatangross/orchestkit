title: "176 Skills That Power Agents"
description: "Reference skills are the knowledge library behind OrchestKit agents -- auto-injected patterns for backend, frontend, databases, security, testing, LLM/RAG, and more."

## What Are Reference Skills?

Reference skills are the 176 skills with `user-invocable: false` in their frontmatter. You never invoke them directly. Instead, they are automatically injected into agent context through three paths:

1. **Agent frontmatter** -- Each agent declares which skills it needs. When the agent spawns, those skills load automatically.
2. **Command skill composition** -- When you run `/ork:implement`, its `skills:` field pulls in reference skills like `api-design-framework` and `unit-testing`.
3. **Keyword auto-suggest** -- The `skill-auto-suggest` hook detects keywords in your prompt and injects matching skills.

Every reference skill declares an `agent:` field in its frontmatter, indicating which agent primarily consumes it. This creates a natural grouping by domain.

## How Reference Skills Get to Agents

The connection between a reference skill and its agent is bidirectional:

1. **Skill side:** The skill's `agent:` frontmatter field declares which agent owns it (e.g., `agent: database-engineer`).
2. **Agent side:** The agent's frontmatter `skills:` array lists the skills it needs.

When the `database-engineer` agent spawns, Claude Code reads its frontmatter, finds the `skills:` array, and injects each listed skill's content into the agent's context window. The agent then has immediate access to all the patterns, examples, and checklists those skills contain.
