description: "orkl vs ork — start universal, upgrade when you need specialized skills."
---

OrchestKit ships as three plugins. Both orkl and ork include **all 36 agents** and **119 hooks**. The difference is skill coverage.

## Quick Decision

```
Do you use Python, React, LLM/RAG, or LangGraph?
  │
  ├─ YES ──▶ Install ork (199 skills, full specialized)
  │
  └─ NO ───▶ Install orkl (88 skills, universal toolkit)
              └─ Need video production? Add ork-creative (16 skills)
```

## Comparison

| | **orkl** (Universal) | **ork-creative** (Video) | **ork** (Full) |

| **Video** | - | Storyboarding, Remotion, demos | All |
| **Python/FastAPI** | - | - | SQLAlchemy, Celery, Alembic, asyncio |
| **React/Next.js** | - | - | RSC, TanStack, Radix, shadcn, Motion |
| **LLM/RAG** | - | - | LangGraph, embeddings, evals, RAG |
| **MCP** | - | - | MCP servers, security hardening |
| **GraphQL** | - | - | Strawberry, gRPC |

## Install

```bash
# Universal — works for any stack
claude install orchestkit/orkl

# Video production add-on
claude install orchestkit/ork-creative

# Full — includes Python, React, LLM/RAG specializations
claude install orchestkit/ork
```

You can switch at any time. Installing `ork` over `orkl` is non-destructive — it adds skills, never removes.

## Recommendation

**Start with `orkl`** if you're unsure. It covers all workflows, security, memory, and CI/CD. Upgrade to `ork` when you need deep Python, React, or AI/LLM expertise.

**Add `ork-creative`** if you need video production — demo recording, Remotion compositions, storyboarding, and content creation tools.

**Start with `ork`** if you're building with FastAPI, React/Next.js, or LLM-powered applications. The extra 111 skills give agents significantly deeper knowledge in these domains.
