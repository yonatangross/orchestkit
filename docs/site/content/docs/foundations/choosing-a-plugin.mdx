title: Choosing a Plugin
description: "OrchestKit is one unified plugin — ork. orkl and ork-creative are backward-compatible aliases."

## One Plugin

OrchestKit ships as a single plugin: **ork** — 69 skills, 38 agents, 78 hooks. There is no longer a tiered system to choose between.

```bash
claude install orchestkit/ork
```

That is all you need.

## Backward-Compatible Aliases

The names `orkl` and `ork-creative` are preserved as install aliases. All three names install the exact same plugin with identical skills, agents, and hooks:

| Name | What It Installs |
|------|-----------------|
| `ork` | 69 skills, 38 agents, 78 hooks |
| `orkl` | Same as ork (alias) |
| `ork-creative` | Same as ork (alias) |

If you previously installed `orkl` or `ork-creative`, they continue to work. Upgrading to `ork` is non-destructive — it is the same content.

## Install

```bash
# Any of these install the same plugin
claude install orchestkit/ork
claude install orchestkit/orkl
claude install orchestkit/ork-creative
```
