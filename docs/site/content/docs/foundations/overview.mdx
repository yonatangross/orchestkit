title: What is OrchestKit?
description: The complete AI development toolkit for Claude Code — 60 skills, 36 agents, 86 hooks working together.

import { Card, Cards } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/card';

OrchestKit is a **Claude Code plugin** that gives your AI assistant deep expertise in software engineering. Instead of explaining your stack on every prompt, OrchestKit injects the right knowledge at the right time.

## Before vs After

| Without OrchestKit | With OrchestKit |
|---|---|
| "Use FastAPI with async, SQLAlchemy 2.0..." | Just describe the feature |
| Manual code review checklists | `/ork:review-pr` runs 3 agents in parallel |
| Copy-paste commit conventions | `/ork:commit` writes conventional commits |
| "Remember to check OWASP..." | Security hooks fire automatically |
| Context lost between sessions | 4-tier memory persists everything |

## How It Works

When you type a prompt, OrchestKit works in three layers:

```
Your Prompt
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HOOKS (86)                          │
│  Fire automatically on every action  │
│  Security gates, auto-lint, memory   │
└──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AGENTS (36)                         │
│  Activate from keywords in prompt    │
│  "review PR" → security-auditor     │
│  "design API" → backend-architect   │
└──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILLS (60)                         │
│  Knowledge injected into agents      │
│  FastAPI patterns, React hooks,      │
│  OWASP checklist, RAG strategies     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Hooks** are invisible guardians — they fire on every tool call, every prompt, every session start/stop. You never invoke them directly.

**Agents** are specialists — they activate when your prompt matches their keywords. Say "review this PR" and three agents spawn in parallel.

**Skills** are knowledge — reusable expertise that gets injected into agents. An agent doesn't need to know everything; it loads the right skills on demand.

## Three Plugins

OrchestKit ships as three plugins so you install only what you need:

| Plugin | Skills | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **orkl** | 43 | Any stack — workflows, memory, security, CI/CD |
| **ork-creative** | 3 | Video production — demo recording, Remotion, storyboarding |
| **ork** | 60 | orkl + creative + Python, React, LLM/RAG, LangGraph, MCP |

All include 86 hooks. orkl and ork include all 36 agents. The difference is skill coverage.
