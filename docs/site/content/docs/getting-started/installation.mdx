import { Card, Cards } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/card';
import { SetupWizard } from '@/components/setup-wizard';

## From Claude Code Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Universal toolkit (44 skills)
claude install orchestkit/orkl

# Full toolkit (61 skills — includes Python, React, LLM/RAG)
claude install orchestkit/ork
```

Not sure which? See [Choosing a Plugin](/docs/foundations/choosing-a-plugin).

## Interactive Setup

<SetupWizard />

## Verify Installation

Run the health check after installing:

```
/ork:doctor
```

Expected output:

```
OrchestKit Health Check
=======================
Plugin:     ork v6.0.6
Skills:     60 loaded (23 commands, 37 reference)
Agents:     36 registered
Hooks:      86 active (63 global, 22 agent, 1 skill-scoped)
Memory:     Graph ✓  Local ✓  Mem0 ○  CC Native ✓
MCP:        memory ✓

Status: Healthy
```

`○` means optional and not configured. `✓` means active.

## Optional: Memory Tiers

OrchestKit works out of the box with Graph Memory and Local Memory. For enhanced capabilities:

| Tier | Env Variable | What It Adds |
|---|---|---|
| Mem0 Cloud | `MEM0_API_KEY` | Semantic search across sessions |
| Tavily Search | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Web research in workflows |
| BrightData | `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN` | Browser automation for scraping |

Set these in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export MEM0_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** >= 2.1.33
- **Node.js** >= 18 (for hooks)
- **Git** (for commit/PR workflows)
