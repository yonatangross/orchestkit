This guide walks you through your first OrchestKit session. By the end, you'll understand how skills, agents, and hooks work together.

## Step 1: Health Check

After installing, verify everything is working:

```
/ork:doctor
```

This runs diagnostics on all 200 skills, 36 agents, and 93 hooks. If anything is misconfigured, it tells you exactly what to fix.

## Step 2: Your First Command Skill

Make a small change to any file in your project, then:

```
/ork:commit
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. The `commit` skill loads — it knows conventional commit format
2. Hooks fire: `git-validator` checks your branch, `dangerous-command-blocker` ensures safety
3. Claude analyzes your staged diff and writes a conventional commit message
4. The commit includes `Co-Authored-By: Claude` attribution

**What you see:**

```
Analyzing staged changes...

Commit message:
  feat: add user email validation to registration form

  Validate email format and check for duplicate emails before
  creating user accounts. Returns 422 with specific error messages.

  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

## Step 3: See Agents Activate

Agents activate from keywords in your natural language. Try:

```
"Review the code I just committed for security issues"
```

**What happens:**
- OrchestKit detects "review" and "security" keywords
- The `security-auditor` agent spawns automatically
- It loads skills: `owasp-top-10`, `defense-in-depth`, `llm-safety-patterns`
- Hooks fire: `security-command-audit` tracks the review

**You didn't name the agent.** You just described what you wanted, and OrchestKit matched the right specialist.

## Step 4: Try Multi-Agent Orchestration

For a more powerful example:

```
/ork:implement "Add rate limiting middleware to the API"
```

This spawns **multiple agents in parallel**:

```
/ork:implement
  │
  ├──▶ backend-system-architect   Plans the implementation
  │     Skills: api-design-framework, rate-limiting, middleware
  │
  ├──▶ test-generator             Writes tests alongside code
  │     Skills: pytest-advanced, integration-testing
  │
  └──▶ security-auditor           Validates the approach
        Skills: owasp-top-10, input-validation
```

## Step 5: Explore the Memory System

OrchestKit remembers across sessions. Try:

```
/ork:remember "We use JWT tokens for auth, not session cookies"
```

This stores your decision in the knowledge graph. In future sessions, when you or an agent works on authentication, this context is automatically injected.

Check what's remembered:

```
/ork:memory search "authentication"
```

## What Just Happened?

In 10 minutes, you used:

- **3 command skills**: `/ork:commit`, `/ork:implement`, `/ork:remember`
- **4 agents**: `security-auditor`, `backend-system-architect`, `test-generator`, plus the commit workflow
- **~15 hooks**: firing invisibly on every action (security gates, memory sync, audit logging)
- **~10 reference skills**: auto-injected into agents (you never invoked them directly)
